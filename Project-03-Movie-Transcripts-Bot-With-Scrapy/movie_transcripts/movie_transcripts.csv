An unlikely apartment building nurtured the careers of a generation of artists and helped to change the future of New York City.

,
,
,financial collapse.,This threat of bankruptcy forced,a chain of improbable events,that led to a groundbreaking,concept in housing.,In Hell's Kitchen, there were,these extraordinary buildings,that ran between 9th and,10th Avenue, down on 43rd to,42nd Street.,I learned to play guitar there.,I learned to play piano there.,I learned to act.,Had my first kiss there.,

,
,Played my first song that I,wrote lyrics to and played the,music to on that piano in that,apartment, in that building.,That building raised me.,It was a place that supported,you and nurtured you.,It's a real home for artists,and for their families.,Just like when Dorothy,clicked her heels, I feel like,there's no place like home.,This wasn't just a place to,live.,This was a community.,I would've had to have left,my chosen field of classical,music if it were not for,Manhattan Plaza.,For as much as I could have a,sense of community, there wasa,sense of community in,Manhattan Plaza.,You know, I've been living here,,what, how many months now?,And... Well, nobody knows.,I don't talk to anybody.,How can anybody know?,You know, and as years go by,,there's a whole new generation,of people who have no idea what,went on and what had to be,done... and what wasdone.,In cities all across America,,these events would change the,way we value the arts and,artists in rebuilding,communities.,So, our idea was attract,artists to Ajo.,It's a kind of a movement.,If you have a better idea,,offer it up.,I can tell that it's the arts.,It really started with artist,housing, and there's a hundred,examples of that all across the,country.,And so much of what went into,Manhattan Plaza was really a,labor of love.,Nobody wanted to live here,because Times Square was bad andseedy.,Manhattan Plaza revitalized,the center of the city.,It was ourbuilding.,Yeah, it wasa miracle.,Hey, dear, make sure that,,when Mia comes in, you just let,her know that this came in, okay?,Okay.,And I told you what was for,dinner.,Mm-hmm.,- Any problems call me.,- All right,Okay, sweetie. Thank you.,Okay, sweetie. Bye-bye, honey.,Bye.,I'm a neighborhood girl.,I was born and raised in the,Chelsea /Clinton/Hell's Kitchen,area.,So I lived on 29th and 10th, in,what was a dying neighborhood.,My first love was musical,theater.,I am an understudy.,I cover four roles.,It means I am there for every,performance... God forbid,,should someone get injured or be,unable to do their role.,And it's at once the hardest and,most amazing job I've ever had.,Right before I moved to,Manhattan Plaza, I was attending,college.,And I remember those long nights,when we'd have rehearsals or,whatever, and I'd be getting out,at 1:00 in the morning, 1:30,,and I had to walk those really,dark, empty streets to 29th and,10th, you know, looking over my,shoulder all the time.,It was not fun.,Back then, this was such a,horrible place to come and live.,[ Up-tempo minor-key piano,[ plays, horse hooves clopping ],For well over a hundred,years, it's been one of the most,infamous neighborhoods in all of,Manhattan... sometimes called,Clinton, sometimes called,Midtown West, it's better known,by the more colorful name,Hell's Kitchen.,From The New York Times,,September 22, 1881...,""Just outside of the square,,bounded by West 40th and,West 38th streets on the north,and the south and by 10th and,11th avenues on the east and,west, is situated a collection,of buildings known to the police,as 'Hell's Kitchen.',The entire locality,"" the,newspaper goes on, ""is probably,the lowest and filthiest in the,city... a locality where law and,order are openly defied.,The whole neighborhood is an,eyesore."",[ Dramatic music plays,,[ indistinct shouting ],We call it ""Hell's Kitchen"",over there, and sometimes we,don't say the ""Kitchen."",The boundaries of the,neighborhood changed over the,years, but the idea of what,Hell's Kitchen was, what it,stood for, persisted for,decades.,It was a tough area.,I mean, tough kids came from,there.,There were the Irish,mobsters, the Westies.,And the Westies were most,visible and notorious from the,1950s to about the 1980s.,The saddest of those cases was,the 1959 ""Capeman"" murders, in,which two teenage boys who had,nothing to do with gangs at all,were killed, and Paul Simon made,a musical out of the notorious,case.,The tough reputation of,Hell's Kitchen was further,enshrined in fictional accounts,of the neighborhood, in films like the,""Sweet Smell of Success."",And, of course,,""West Side Story."",It's where Daredevil battled,crime and where another,Marvel Comic antihero,,Jessica Jones, got her start.,Because of the neighborhood's,bad reputation, the rents are,inexpensive.,On the other hand, your cheap,apartment is just a 10-minute,walk from the Broadway theaters,,so guess who's going to live there.,Starting in the early 1950s,,Hell's Kitchen was where,performers learned their craft,,at places like,The Actors Studio, the,New Dramatists playwright,center, and, later, the Improv,comedy club.,For generations, struggling,actors, comics, dancers,,musicians, and behind-the-scenes,workers called it home, no,matter how humble.,I was living on,West 43rd Street, between 8th,and 9th Avenue when I was first,starting out doing stand-up,comedy.,It was one of those railroad,apartments.,I had to take my army boot off,when I walked in the apartment,to go on a roach hunt to kill,the roaches.,In the early 1970s,,conditions in Hell's Kitchen,went from bad to worse, as,America was plunged into a,severe economic recession.,Today we have a unique form,of economic imbalance... a lot,of inflation combined with,definite conditions of a,recession.,The recession was the result,of several factors... increased,foreign competition in,manufacturing, the Arab oil,embargo in 1973 that nearly,quadrupled the price of oil, and,uncertainty resulting from the,demise of the gold standard for,U.S. currency.,This led to an unusual,combination of economic,stagnation, rising unemployment,,but also soaring interest rates,and inflation... a condition,which came to be known as,""stagflation."",Unemployment is above normal,levels because of our...,In New York City, the urban,decay, which had been localized,in areas like Hell's Kitchen,,spread.,It was ugly. It was bad.,It was shocking even to a cop.,The crime rate was soaring, and,it wasn't only that... it was,the perception of crime because,it looked so bad.,I mean, it really looked bad.,In Manhattan, the,transformation was most shocking,in the Broadway/Times Square,theater district.,If you walked down,42nd Street on a Friday night,,you couldn't get through one...,it looked like New Year's Eve,except everybody was a bad guy.,42nd Street then and now, I,think, is the most celebrated,street in New York, and I think,everybody felt that there's,something wrong that this legend,should be living like a bum.,The lives of these theaters,was endangered.,People were shunning the area.,They weren't coming.,Something simply had to be done.,I said, ""How did this happen,so quickly?,How did all these massage,parlors, and how are these porn,places, and how come all the,prostitutes are out?"",For the first half of the,20th century, you have dozens,and dozens of these,Broadway-related shops in the,Times Square and Hell's Kitchenarea.,And as those begin to close, as,those begin to consolidate, you,then have a lot of vulnerable,buildings that don't have a,tenant, that may be abandoned,,and they are ripe for the,picking in terms of criminal,uses, adult entertainment.,And so the diminishing,blue-collar world of Broadway,left Times Square vulnerable to,adult entertainment and crime.,And it helps to explain why, of,all the neighborhoods, this,Times Square and Hell's Kitchen,section of Manhattan was so,inundated.,As the recession hits,,New York City goes on an,austerity campaign, and police,,fire, and other public services,are cut.,Conditions in most of our,central cities are shameful.,Nowhere is the blight more,acute than in the heart of,Hell's Kitchen.,Between 42nd and 43rd, 9th,and 10th Avenue was kind of like,the Wild Wild West.,9th Avenue was pretty much,controlled by transvestite,hookers.,It's kind of like, ""Where are,the cops?!"",I had a very vivid New York,education working from 11:00,until 7:00 in the morning in,Manhattan Plaza.,Every night when I walked,home from the Improv, I would,pretend that I was a heroin,addict so people would leave me,alone.,I'd wobble, I'd stagger,like that, you know?,The massage parlors were just,horrible, and nobody was making,any money.,And so the owners didn't really,want to own the buildings,,because who wants to own,unprofitable massage parlors?,In the early 1970s, when most,builders were ignoring the,West Side, Richard Ravitch, then,an executive of,HRH Construction, took another,look.,And he saw this property, and,it was for sale.,The property, bounded by 9th,and 10th avenues on the east and,west, 43rd to 42nd streets on,the north and south, was owned,by the Durst real-estate family.,Where most people saw tenement,apartments and a parking lot,,Ravitch envisaged something,else.,In the early '70s,,HRH Construction built,Waterside Plaza, a middle-income,high-rise on Manhattan's,East Side.,It's a formula Ravitch thinks,could work on the West Side, as,well.,A deal was made to acquire,this site with the idea of,bringing upwardly mobile people,into the area.,It's a plan without precedent,in Hell's Kitchen... a health,club, a swimming pool, a,playground, a parking garage,,five tennis courts, two towers,,1,689 apartments.,I have the privilege of,announcing the formation of the,Times Square Development,Council, which will be...,Lindsay was mayor, and they,were gonna transform the,West Side.,Eventually, a deal was made to,build middle-income housing from,9th Avenue to 10th Avenue, from,42nd to 43rd, with the idea of,bringing upwardly mobile people,into Hell's Kitchen.,Ravitch and Fischer access,New York State funding called,the Mitchell-Lama housing,program.,The program offered tax and,mortgage incentives to,developers of low- and,middle-income housing.,With Mitchell-Lama secured, the,city agrees to loan the builders,nearly all of the $95 million in,construction costs.,Soon, the development is full,speed ahead, and it has a,name... Manhattan Plaza.,The year is 1974.,The plan is for Manhattan Plaza,to be fully rented and open by,1976.,But there are doubters.,The New York Timescalls,Manhattan Plaza ""the biggest,real-estate gamble in the city."",Several tenements were torn,down, and Hell's Kitchen,families were displaced to start,construction.,When they proposed this,housing, many people attended,those meetings about, ""How tall,was it gonna be?,44? 48?,No, we don't want that here."",We lived on 41st Street, and,my father used to carry me on,his shoulder to go to the,bathroom in the backyard.,Bathrooms in the hallway, no,private showers, no heat.,People did say, ""Why are they,building a luxury building?,Weneed apartments."",But as construction,continued, double-digit,inflation hit, and things got,more complicated.,As interest rates soar, so do,Manhattan Plaza's projected,rents.,The problem was that the,rents were gonna be much higher,because interest rates were,higher, and we had to go to the,next brackets up, and that was,not gonna be easy.,The soaring projected rental,costs, combined with the city's,insolvency, came to a head in,1975.,We're facing up to the,financial crisis confronting,this city and state.,We need your help!,I know you're going to give it.,In 1975, Mayor Abraham Beame,made a bold move to protect the,city's investment.,The change in direction,jeopardized and ultimately,revolutionized Manhattan Plaza.,Unwanted and unrentable,,Manhattan Plaza stands as a,towering failure.,Suddenly, there was no,market, and the city could've,lost $90 million, which was a,huge mortgage hit at that time,,so they proposed to make it into,a low-income project.,In a surprise move, the city,secured new federal funding.,The program provides,project-based assistance for,low-income tenants, better known,as Section 8 housing.,I didn't really know what,Section 8 was.,Well, I remembered from the,army, a Section 8 was something,that, if you were insane or,mentally disabled, that was your,discharge.,So, I called up a lawyer who,was very, very active in housing,in the federal government, and I,asked him what Section 8 housing,was.,Well, he says, ""It's the lowest,form of subsidized housing, and,the record is it always turns a,neighborhood down."",There was a lot of fear.,There was a feeling that it,would bring down the real-estate values.,They were down pretty far.,I don't know how much further,they could've gone.,Broadway theater owners,confronted Roger Starr, the,city's head of housing and,development.,I said, ""If you want to,convert this to Section 8,housing, we're gonna sue you."",He said, ""You're jeopardizing,the city's $95 million mortgage,,and the city is broke."",I said, ""You're gonna destroy,this area."",The abandoned building was a,financial disaster.,Every day, it cost the city,$16,000 in interest.,Something had to happen fast.,Some neighborhood residents,called for the building to be,torn down brick by brick.,You're gonna destroy this area!,This is discrimination!,Faced with mounting,opposition from local residents,and theater owners, the city and,Manhattan Plaza's builders seek,out the help of the,Settlement Housing Fund, a,nonprofit that specializes in,affordable housing.,They asked us if we would,recommend how to rent the,buildings out, and I said,,""Yeah, come on.,We got to have some fun."",So we said yes, we would form,this committee, and a lot of,people came and made,suggestions.,And I would pass this,building when it was being,built, and I'd say, ""Geez, it,would be wonderful if we could,get one or two apartments for,actors on the lower floors,,where nobody wants to be that,close to the traffic."",In Times Square,,Gerald Schoenfeld confers with,another Broadway producer,,Alexander H. Cohen.,I went out for dinner with,Alex Cohen, and the subject,drifted into Manhattan Plaza.,""If it's going to be for the,poor,"" Cohen tells Schoenfeld,,""let's make it for ourpoor."",He said, ""You know, that,should be 'the actors',bedroom.'"",I said, ""Alex, that's the,answer.,Now, you keep your big mouth,shut and leave it to me."",Broadway producers became,quite the supporters of saving,the project and directing it,towards housing for artists.,We formed a board committee.,A lot of people came and made,suggestions, and one of them was,to dedicate the building to,performing artists.,It was Dan Rose.,""Oh, wouldn't it be great to,have movie stars living there,,Broadway stars.,Make this a class act."",I don't know who came up with,the idea.,It might've been Schoenfeld.,It was my idea.,We got performing artists,into Manhattan Plaza.,Nobody really knows for sure,whose idea it was, but there are,a lot of people who take credit,for it.,And that's fine, too, because it,was a good idea.,They had to come up with a,group of people that could be,poor but yet socially acceptable,to the community board.,We have all kinds of people,of all kinds of backgrounds,working in the theater.,And we found out the incomes,,and, lo and behold, Equity,members had no money.,Theater is such an on-and-off,business, you know?,People don't know from one week,to the next whether their show's,gonna close, and yet the public,need to be entertained.,Research showed actors are,good fits for Section 8,financial requirements.,They were actors, and they,were poor.,They were low-income.,Good grief, you can't earn a,lot of money all the time.,One year, you could be on,Broadway, make a lot of money,,and the next year, you were,unemployed.,A plan was proposed.,""Manhattan Plaza will remain a,Section 8 project, but its,subsidies will go to qualified,actors, singers, dancers, and,behind-the-scene members of the,entertainment community.,They would never have built a,building like Manhattan Plaza,from scratch for actors.,♪ We have all that jazz,A Midtown business group,wages a legal fight, arguing,Section 8 housing will doom the,area, with or without actors.,The idea kept getting,hammered.,The community was outraged.,""How could you have this,subsidized housing and not,include us?"",Housing activists say the,city should spread the,Section 8 subsidies around, it,should benefit more than just,one neighborhood, and the people,of Hell's Kitchen demand to be,included, also.,These people have to live!,They've got to have a home.,And they're not gonna have a,home if you're gonna do what,you're doing.,To me, 9th Avenue has always,been my home, so the store,owners and the people who lived,here got involved and said, ""We,can't have this."",We went to the,Board of Estimate hearings.,We agreed that some portion of,this had to go back to the,community, and it included,people who had lived here for,many, many years... 40, 50,years.,So then was all this,negotiation... at,Holy Cross Church one night, a,meeting with everybody screaming,and ranting and carrying on.,It'll be a disaster.,Order! Order!,February 4, 1977...,the fate of the building was,determined.,It did hang by a thread.,Everything was so tenuous, and,the city was in a very tenuous time.,Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman!,Actors rallied support for,the revised plan... among them,,Oscar winner Estelle Parsons.,We're gonna sue!,My family needs help more,than actors.,We need...,""Everybody is always getting,something out of the society,they live in except for the,performer.,And all that the performers are,really asking for with,Manhattan Plaza is an,opportunity to live on campus.,Broadway is our turf.,You know, without a,performing-arts community,,New York City would be like five,Clevelands.,Gentlemen, if you want to keep a,rosy glow on The Big Apple, do a,little something for the,performing arts.,It will come back to you a,thousandfold."",That's it.,A deal was made to allocate,the apartments... 10% for,Mitchell-Lama middle income,,then 70% for performing artists,and mixed incomes, 15% for,neighborhood elderly, 15% for,local residents living in,substandard housing.,And the federal government,provided the funding which saved,Manhattan Plaza, which saved the,city's $95 million mortgage.,And it was the beginning of the,renaissance of Times Square.,And that's how it became that,us guys got the place.,June of 1977,,Manhattan Plaza opened its,doors.,But the timing couldn't have,been worse.,[ Disco music plays, indistinct,[ cheering and shouting ],When lightning strikes,,New York is paralyzed... no,lights, no trains.,That summer, New Yorkers were,terrorized by the serial killer,David Berkowitz, also known as,""Son of Sam."",The city was in the grips of a,record-breaking heat wave, and,on July 13th, a lightning strike,caused a two-day blackout over,the entire region.,There is some sporadic,looting.,Ironically, it was also the,summer New York premiered the ad,campaign ""I Love New York."",♪ ...love New York,♪ I love New York,Manhattan Plaza has 1,689,apartments.,It has a thousand-car garage, 15,commercial tenants.,It take up a city block in,New York City.,It is a very, very big place,with about 3,500 people living here.,And we hammered out the,regulations for the community,and what meant being a,performing artist.,The requirements were,very, very strict.,And I was wondering if,comedians fit that bill because,I never really considered myself,that, but I was told, ""Yes, they,do fit.,You could apply."",You didn't just get in here,because Ithought you were a,performing artist.,A committee of your peers had to,review the files.,Not many people realize this,,but the first hundred or so,apartments that were rented here,were rented on the basis of live,auditions.,So...,I moved in November 1977.,I was paying $57 a month, and,this was in November... I moved,in November 1977.,That was my rent... $57 a month.,Even then, we had trouble,convincing people to move here,,as great a deal as it was.,Many people would not even,come and look at the apartments.,I said, ""Oh, really.,Well, where is it?"",And they said, ""43rd and 9th."",And I said famously... you know,,we always laugh about it... I,said, ""I'll never live there."",We had to pound,Actors Equity.,SAG people didn't want to move.,People would not traverse,7th Avenue to walk over to,9th Avenue.,Nobody wanted to live across,the street from those massage,parlors.,So, it took about a year to,rent up all the units, little,over a year... all the 1,689.,Slowly, you know, they did,,and the word spread.,And then we got something,like 10,000... we had 10,000,applications.,Under the Section 8 program,,a resident's rent is adjusted on,a sliding scale as their income,fluctuates, which fits actors',lives perfectly.,We had heard about this place,called Manhattan Plaza, where,actors could actually only pay,one fourth their gross income,,and our income was as gross as,you could possibly...,I remember thinking like,,""Cupboards like they have in,real houses, like, with doors,that aren't, you know, bathed in,50 layers of paint, that don't,close."",Now, I moved in the building,in 1979.,The 9th Avenue building was just,about full, and the 10th Avenue,building was beginning to be full.,My doorman at the time was,Samuel L. Jackson.,My first jobjob... the first,and only job I ever had outside,of theater.,My grandmother lived there,with my great-grandmother,,Minnie Gentry.,Minnie Gentry played my,mother in so many different,plays and just a really,wonderful, wonderful actor...,grandmother of Terrence Howard.,And when she became ill with,cancer, she looked me in the,eye, and she said, ""Take care of,my boy."",And I said, ""Oh, Minnie, come on.,You know, I love this boy."",And Giancarlo Esposito, he,was, you know, a big star.,Who told you to buy a,brownstone on my block, in my,neighborhood, on my side of the,street?!,And I used to come up to his,apartment at 15 years old and,knock on his door just because,he had said hi to me on the plaza.,And I would ask him, ""Will you,read these lines with me?"",I'd say, ""What are you doing up?,You should be sleeping."",He said, ""Well, I couldn't sleep,'cause I don't know my lines."",I said, ""Well, that's the firststep.,Know your lines, and then we can,work."",He showed me the value of an,artist by his willingness to,help a young artist who had,never even had a job.,I'm definitely a,Manhattan Plaza baby, and my,mother was a single mother and a,struggling actress trying to,figure out which way to go, what,to do.,I lived there from the age of,3 to 22.,I believe my brother Dade was,the first kid born in,Manhattan Plaza.,I was the first desk guy at,the 10th Avenue building...,overnight.,Philip Seymour Hoffman was a,counselor.,He was the dude that took the,kids and hung out with the kids,and stuff like that.,I remember certain people,moving in.,I guess I saw Terrence when he,was a little bitty kid.,I used to see Alicia Keys in,the Ellington Room, messing,around on the piano with little,bucked teeth, you know?,And she was just trying, just,trying... 7, 8 years old.,The whole Faison family was a,big part of my growing up.,They would put on shows and,perform Jackson 5 songs in the,Ellington Room.,But it's kind of cool to be,like, ""I grew up in the same,building."",During the course of,rehearsals of ""Sweeney Todd,"",the word came out that there was,this extraordinary building down,on 43rd to 42nd street in,New York City.,There was, I think, 10% that,they were allowed to lease to,prospective renters who would,pay the full tilt.,You got people from,New York City Opera, you got,people from New York City,Ballet, you got people from,Metropolitan Opera, you got,people from Broadway.,Gaffers, electricians.,Got filmmakers, dancers,,choreographers.,Wardrobe people.,Designers, casting agents.,A lot of writers.,Tennessee Williams once,patted my ass on the elevator,,and I liked it.,If that's not quintessential,Manhattan Plaza...,Within the housing community,,there's a lot of difficulty,because there are the ones who,say, ""Only the poorest of the,poor,"" and there are those of us,who say, ""You need mixed-income,housing, integrated,economically, ethnically.,You need a mix."",It's better than low-income,housing, where you create a,ghetto.,You create a mixed community,here, and that's the strength of,Manhattan Plaza.,I built a lot of city housing,,and I watched it get destroyed,because they didn't have a total,system.,We don't have a graffiti,problem.,We don't have a vandalism,problem.,We would not tolerate it.,If your child was guilty of,vandalism, you were read the,Riot Act, and if you can't be,responsible, we're gonna move to,evict you.,It's a very idealistic,approach to housing for people,who work in our business, in the,theater.,I came in as a performer, got,blown up on a film, so that,totally, completely paralyzed my,right side.,If I wasn't here, I would've,been out on the street a long,time ago.,Number one, it's the greatest,place to have children and raise,them, but, number two, if you,have a disability, which I,do... I have one leg... it's the,most accessible place.,It's so wonderful to be able,to come in my building, go down,my hall, open my door, and go in,and have no fear.,No fear.,Mwah!,You looking lovely.,Happy birthday.,Happy birthday! Thank you!,Hello, Larry. How are you?,Right there, shoulder to,shoulder, sharing the elevator,,sharing the lobby, living in the,same community... actual,economic diversity.,I mean, it was a wonderful,sociological experiment.,When Daniel was performing in,""Mamma Mia!"" he would always,say, whenever we paid the rent,,""I want to pay the maximum,because it means we're working,,we're doing well."",But then, when he got sick and,we didn't know what was going to,happen, we didn't have to leave,our home, because our rent was,adjusted.,We could stay.,""I used to think..."",You know, I found out gradually,that it was terminal.,Friends from our floor organized,amongst themselves to prepare,dinners.,We had the community close to,us.,Everyone helped.,The goals were to create a,vibrant, supportive community,,and we didn't have a blueprint,to follow.,And so the blueprint was,created.,In the most innovative move of,all, Fischer hired an Episcopal,priest with no experience in,building management to run,Manhattan Plaza.,Nobody would've hired,Rodney Kirk to be the managing,director of 1,689 units of,housing.,""What are you, out of your mind,,'Irv'?"",And he said, ""You know, I'm,gonna go with it."",I did not want anyone who had,preconceived notions of what,this housing should be.,Rodney Kirk, the,Reverend Rodney Kirk, really had,a vision.,I mean, I think he saw this as,,""I'm gonna have a parish.,Here we go."",And that's exactly what,happened, and we all learned on,the job."",Richard came along at the,same time as Rodney Kirk.,Rodney and I were both from,small towns in North Carolina.,And when you moved,into a small town in,North Carolina, somebody showed,up at the door, you know, a,person from the ""welcome wagon."",So we had a welcome wagon.,The unique thing was that I,visited every floor of this,building and I visited every,apartment.,Each floor was willing to say,,""We would like to be a,community."",Rodney was determined that it,was not gonna be like another,building here in New York.,In New York City, before,Manhattan Plaza, there was,Westbeth, affordable live/work,space for artists in the,Far West Village.,In Lower Manhattan, the SoHo,neighborhood, too, was pioneered,by artists, but quickly became,so desirable that artists were,priced out.,When people complain about,gentrification, they always,point to SoHo as an example of,where it went off the rails,because there probably aren't,that many artists who live there,anymore.,As a sense of community,started to take hold at,Manhattan Plaza, new challenges,arose.,It's believed more people,have died from AIDS at,Manhattan Plaza than on any,other residential block in the country.,But rather than tearing this,community apart, what that harsh,reality has done, in fact, is,bring it closer together.,One day, Rodney woke up, he,says, ""This is happening.,People are dying."",Probably we had the second,diagnosed case of AIDS.,It was here at Manhattan Plaza.,We would have, for a number of,years, anywhere from 90 to 100,people a year who would die.,And Rodney Kirk created this,organization that, to this day,,is still active.,What other apartment complex,had an AIDSProject?,Nobody, nobody.,We provided the medical,support, the food... everything,a person needed to live with,this disease.,How are ya?,Good.,I lost about 10 people in the,building.,Mercy Hinton...,I left my job.,I was teaching at the,university.,And I left my,job to take care of him when I,found out he was sick.,Matter of fact, he died in my,arms.,We went to Juilliard together.,I'm the only one left.,This community has said,,""We're not afraid to care, and,we're not afraid to love, and,we're not afraid to hold people,who have AIDS."",Rodney retired in '97... had,lung cancer, and he had,emphysema.,When Rodney died, the,Stay Well Center was renamed in,Rodney's honor.,The charter was expanded to,include anyone who was,terminally or chronically ill.,Neighbors helping neighbors.,That's really what it's about.,Rodney was given a gift, he,would say, and he just wanted to,work it and make it special.,And he did.,Outside of Manhattan Plaza, a,neighborhood began raising,itself up.,Right from the get-go, the,word ""community"" was really,important.,You know, we had a lot of folks,from this community, and there,was a sense of wanting to invest,in it.,In other words, ""We got to make,this work.,We're the experiment."",I mean, I don't think anyone was,oblivious to that, that this was,an experiment and, ""We hope it,works, and we're gonna make it,work."",As the Manhattan Plaza,community took hold, the,nonprofit 42nd Street,Development Corporation began,purchasing derelict properties,across the street.,Then we started this company,to see if we could rescue the,west end of 42nd Street.,We were able to acquire all the,properties on the south side of,42nd Street, between 9th and,10th Avenue.,And Bob Moss, who started and,ran Playwrights Horizons, he,said, ""Well, what are you gonna,stick in them?"",And I said, ""Whatever we think,will trigger a renewal over,here."",And he said, ""Make them,theaters."",And that's how Theatre Row got,started.,On the other side of,42nd Street from,Manhattan Plaza, strip joints,,massage parlors, and porn shops,were displaced by six small,theaters, including one named in,memory of Rodney Kirk.,Playhouses replaced sex shops,,and a new kind of nightlife,emerged.,Good users push out bad,users, and so Manhattan Plaza,gave off signals to the,investment community and the,real-estate community that,things were gonna be better.,And instead of people renting,out to massage parlors, they,started renting out to local,little stores.,When we came here, there was nothing.,There was absolutely nothing.,What happened as a result of all,of these energetic young and old,and this wonderful mix of people,moving into this building, it,was the rebirth of this,neighborhood and this community.,I moved to Manhattan Plaza in,the early '80s.,I had just come back from doing,a play in Italy.,I called my agent, and my agent,said, ""Arnold who?"",And that kind of let,me know that I didn't want a,theater career anymore.,So I decided that even though I,understood myself as a creative,person, that I could be creative,in other areas of my life.,And Arnold started baking his,grandmother's apple sour cream,walnut pie in his apartment, and,he burned out three ovens.,I knew that, at one point,,the building was gonna say,something.,So I called Arnold, and I,said, ""Arnold, you can't keep,doing this, okay?"",We were able to work with him in,getting the store, building it,for him on 43rd Street, and that,was the beginning of,Little Pie Company.,When neighborhood kids who,were just sitting out on the,stoop would come in, it was fun,to give those kids an,opportunity, give them,responsibility, and see them,turn their lives around.,The climate of change in,Hell's Kitchen spreads eastward.,In Times Square, new tax,incentives and zoning changes,spur development.,There's no more startling,turnaround of any urban,environment anywhere in America,than is happening right here on,42nd street.,Times Square never looks,back.,Businesses, economic activity,follow people, and they,particularly follow people like,artists.,So if you bring artists into the,center of town... and this is,true in a lot of very challenged,and difficult neighborhoods all,across the country... you bring,artists in there, and those,places start to transform.,Everyone's investing money in,all these classic, deteriorated,neighborhoods.,You know what?,If you invest in people, you,will be rewarded.,Our mandate, self-imposed,,was to create a climate,conducive to the renaissance of,Times Square, which is what we,did.,1, 2, 3.,Lay out.,And Manhattan Plaza comes,roaring into the void and,supplies at least the homes of,the artists and the,craftspeople, at least the,rehearsal studios of the,musicians, but the fact that,they gave people a place to,live, a place to live,affordably, I think is one of,the vital reasons why Broadway,stayed so strong even through,the rough-and-tumble '70s and,'80s.,I think Manhattan Plaza was just,crucial for the survival of,Broadway as we know it, for live,theater, for skilled,craftspeople, skilled musicians.,They deserve a lot of credit,with that, Manhattan Plaza.,If you don't have to spend,all of your resources and all of,your energy just to make your,rent, then all other parts of,your life can improve and grow.,You were free to do,everything.,The whole reason I can play,piano is because of the woman,we found in that building.,A woman was leaving and couldn't,take the piano, and she said,,""If you can move it, you can,have it."",And it was an upright piano, an,old brown upright piano.,And so we dragged it across the,Manhattan Plaza ourselves.,One of the first songs that I,wrote, I remember specifically,rushing home.,My mother and I went to go see,""Philadelphia"" the movie, and I,was really moved by that movie,,and it just made me cry.,And I remember sitting at the,piano... it was late at night...,and writing my first song on,that piano in that apartment, in,that building.,People would say ""good luck"",when I had an audition rather,than, ""Hey, who's gonna guard my,building.,Come back!"",It was a healthy environment.,It was a great learning,experience.,I'm still kind of using some of,that stuff when I work,sometimes, just the freeness and,the wildness of New York in the,'70s.,I had started auditioning,when I was living in,Manhattan Plaza, and I remember,I had auditioned for ""Clueless"",like four or five times at this,point, and it was the final,callback.,All my friends from the building,and my mom, we went into the,staircase, and I ran lines for,like two hours.,Excuse me, Ms. Dionne.,It was my first big job that I,ever got in Hollywood.,I remember crying in front of,the building to move out to,Los Angeles.,I remember looking at the,building and being like, ""Eh,,peace."",In the late '70s, there were,maybe 30 stand-up comics in the,country, and 12 of them lived in,Manhattan Plaza.,Where else could you get to meet,somebody like Larry David?,One night, after I had moved,into the building, they had a,talent show, and Kenny Kramer,was running this talent show for,people in the building.,Everybody I called, I called,them up... ""Hi.,I'm Kenny Kramer.,I'm a fellow comic.,Building's putting on this,talent night.,How would you feel about doing,10 minutes of your material in,front of your neighbors for 100,bucks on a Tuesday night?"",Everybody's going, ""Yeah, count,me in, yeah!"" till I get to,Larry David.,He wanted me to perform at,the cabaret, and I was deathly,afraid that, if I performed and,bombed, they were gonna throw me,out of the building.,And so I came over, and I,said, ""I don't know what your problem is.,You're very funny.,Do the show."",He says, ""You know, okay, I'll,do the show."",Day of the show, like 3:00 in,the afternoon, he calls me up.,He says, ""Yo, Kramer, I can't dothis.,I changed my mind.,I'm not gonna do this."",I said, ""Look, I don't know what,your problem is, but if you,don't show up and do this gig,,we will not be talking again."",And then, a few expletives,later, I hung up on him.,So, 9:00 at night, his time,slot... shows up.,Please welcome Larry David!,I was very reluctant to do,this tonight because I felt,that, if anybody from,management, uh...,...saw my act, I would be thrown,out of the building.,""You're a performer?,Get the fuck out of here, pal.,Come on. Beat it."",I had a party for all the,cast of the show afterward, and,he was the hit of the party, and,the next day, he shows up at my,door unannounced.,""Hey, you want to go get some,breakfast?"",And we started hanging out, and,we became best friends.,He was constantly coming in,and out of my apartment, and I,was going into his apartment all,the time, as well... opening,each other's refrigerators,,eating each other's food.,When Larry was approached by,Jerry Seinfeld to create a,television show, he based the,character Kramer on me.,Hey!,Hey.,Jerry and I wrote the pilot,in my apartment.,I went from like an obscure,comedian to an international,icon like that.,And ""Seinfeld"" was sold while,I was living in Manhattan Plaza.,Creativity plus affordable,housing plus a dash of psychosis,equals ""Seinfeld."",That's who was at the plaza,,these people that were just,sharing and dreaming.,If that was kind of the,energy of the entire building,,then I do feel, in some way of,osmosis... poof!,By the early 2000s, the wait,list for apartments at,Manhattan Plaza seems to run as,long as the towers stand tall.,There are presently eight,different waiting lists for,Manhattan Plaza.,On this list, I have 630 people.,I have to juggle all these,categories, all these people,,all these applications.,That's my performing arts.,I'm a juggler.,But, soon, Manhattan Plaza,reached a crossroads.,Initial reaction was a bit of,panic, like, ""What's gonna,happen to our home?,What are these people gonna do?"",When you ask the question,,""What's the future bring?"" how,do you protect yourselves and,how do you protect your,constituency?,I got a phone call from,The New York Timesthat was,doing an article about the,building being sold, did I have,a comment.,And I said, ""What?"",""It's being sold?"",Now that the people had,pioneered this area, suddenly,the property values are going up,surrounding Manhattan Plaza.,And a lot of people, I think,,were fearful that, now that the,artists had done their... task,,let's say, like certain bacteria,in nature which devour the,rotted material of before, that,it's now time for others to come,in and reap the rewards.,In 2003, the real-estate,investors that owned,Manhattan Plaza informed,Irving Fischer they wanted to,sell the building and take their,profit.,We have been under a lot of,pressure.,The big fear was that we would,do what other people were doing,,which was get out of the,Mitchell-Lama program and the,Section 8 subsidy program and,convert this to market-rate,apartments.,Irving Fischer announced the,future plan for the building to,Manhattan Plaza residents.,At the time of sale, I think,that everybody was so anxious,about, ""Was the building in,jeopardy?"",Yes, because what if,Irv Fischer who sold to someone,who had no interest in,Manhattan Plaza and maintaining,the community, and what was,going to happen?,Related Companies, a leading,developer of affordable housing,,made a push to buy the building.,Is what Related...,At that resident meeting, we,knew we were gonna stand up,there in front of a whole bunch,of people who were passionate,about their homes.,The issues of maintaining the,quality of the housing are very,,very important.,Is there anything that you do,plan to change?,We are responsible for the,revitalization of Times Square.,Don't let anyone bullshit you.,People don't trust you, and,you have to earn it, and Irving,had so much vested personally,and emotionally.,He was the builder of it, he had,watched it grow, and he,literally wanted to make sure,that whoever bought the building,would see it as more than real,estate, but more as a social,asset.,The Related company purchased,Manhattan Plaza in March of,2004, so, yes, I think it was in,jeopardy, and I think that,Related turned out to really,want this and to really,understand what they were buying,and have worked hard to maintain,it.,Well, I think that city's,impoverished if they don't have,artists living there.,I think most cities want them,and make arrangements to have,them in one way or another.,But you don't want artists to be,priced out of your neighborhood,,out of your community.,Around the country,,forward-thinking communities are,trying experiments in,artist-based housing.,Far away from Manhattan Plaza,,Ajo, Arizona, is one such,community.,Ajo is a tiny, remote, rural,town in the middle of the,Sonoran Desert.,It feels like you're in the,middle of nowhere.,The copper mine closed in the,mid 1980s as the result of a,bitter strike that divided,families, and that was,economically devastating.,In 2000, when I came here, there,was very little recovery.,At the opposite end of the,country, AS220 rose from the,ashes of downtown Providence,,Rhode Island.,Providence in the mid '80s,,it was at its lowest point of,its entire 300-something-year,history.,AS220 is a nonprofit,organization started in 1985,with literally $800 that I had,in an illegal loft space.,250 miles away, the mayor of,Rahway, New Jersey, tried a,different approach.,I was the mayor of Rahway,from 1991 till 2011.,I got involved in trying to turn,the town around.,The theater at that point had,gone XXX, and,""Sex With a Teenage Cheerleader"",was the marquee read.,The story of live/work artist,housing in Ajo began with the,Curley School, a building that,was built in 1918.,It was crumbling.,There was a group of artists in,town.,We got together and decided we'd,try to save the building.,I had known Artspace from,Minneapolis and had seen their,live/work projects.,We decided to see if the,Curley School could be converted,to live/work artist housing.,The real hope is that we would,attract artists who would do the,sort of thing that happens in,inner cities... create an,economic vitality that would,result in other spin-off,businesses.,As we evaluated the assets of,the community for redevelopment,,right in front of us was the,deteriorating Union County,Performing Arts Center.,That became the base of looking,at the arts as a stimulus.,You open a theater in a,neighborhood, it's not just the,administrators and the actors,and the ushers that get,employed.,It's the parking-lot attendants,next door and the restaurants,and the hotels.,It is a very leveraging and,powerful economic force.,Fast-forward 28 years...,we're a $4 million budget with,three buildings and 60 staff,,about 100,000 square feet of,space, about 50 artists that,live in the spaces... affordable,live/work studios, commercial,tenants.,So they're truly mixed-use,developments... the youth,program that serves about 150,youth, four or five spaces that,we use as galleries, our media,lab, our fabrication laboratory,,our print shop, our own,restaurant and bar, two,performance spaces.,I think that kind of covers it.,Yeah, it's pretty remarkable.,These visionary leaders are,sometimes nationally known as,""creative placemakers."",They make dedicated homes for,the arts, culture, and,creativity, sometimes despite,tremendous obstacles.,AS220 is on a mission, and it,only is meaningful if it can,influence other people.,You're educating kids.,You're growing families.,What better way to do that than,to embrace the arts?,Around the country, derelict,communities have been pioneered,by artists, then transformed.,Places like SoHo and,Lower Manhattan, Venice Beach in,Southern California, and the,Lowertown neighborhood in,St. Paul, Minneapolis, are a few,prominent examples.,You have abandoned housing or,houses that can be bought for,,you know, $3,000.,Who are occupying these places?,Well, generally, it's artists,,and when they're there, other,people follow, and suddenly you,get a neighborhood again.,Anytime you want to use,public money to create a public,benefit, you have to determine,why, and that's the value,proposition, right?,Young artists need support,,but I don't think it's written,anywhere that performing artists,should be supported for the rest,of their lives.,Why should they be?,I'd be surprised if some,people aren't resentful at sort,of special treatment that,artists are getting.,Some people see the arts as a,luxury and not essential.,Artists are very often good,investments.,First of all, some of them,become very rich and successful,like Alicia Keys or Larry David.,Manhattan Plaza is a great,place, and I think there's a,part of me that is really glad,that I got out.,When you only have to pay a,percentage of your income as,your rent, you have that sense,in the back of your head, ""I,don't want too much success.,I don't want to move to the next,level."",To say to you that nobody,here is lazy would be an,out-and-out lie.,This program allows you to,become lazy.,You can become lazy because your,rent is based on your income, so,if you're not working, you're,not paying a big rent.,However, that's not what this,was designed for.,I believe that most of the,people that live here really and,truly appreciate what they have.,Does it stifle you from,wanting to work?,No, it just made me not afraid.,It gave me that security to know,that I could take that chance.,It was one thing when you,were at the low end of the,spectrum on the sliding scale of,the income, and, for years, I,was at that low end, and that,was fine.,I'm paying very little rent.,I got the one-bedroom with the terrace.,But then I started making,some money, and then I was at,the higher end.,And I remember having this,conversation with Rodney.,He looked at me and said,,""Giancarlo, you're gonna have to,make a decision."",And I said, ""Well, what's,that, Rodney?"",He said, ""Well, now you're at,the top of the scale.,You want to pay the fair market,price or not?"",And I thought about it.,I said, ""It's only fair, right?"",And he said, ""Now you got it."",So, for years after that, I was,at the top of the scale, paid,the top rent.,I deserved to pay that, because,I was supported in that way,for so long.,So, in that way, it taught me,how to not only take,but to give back, as well.,One of the reasons I don't,think we see a lot of artist,housing is that it's hard to,create a value proposition,that makes sense to a voting,electorate.,It's not a broad-enough,constituency.,The value isn't meaningful.,We don't want just, you know,,hedge-fund managers and rich,people populating our city.,We want a certain mix, and that,mix has to include artists.,Okay, you wait for Mommy and,then you do it, and then we see,what it sounds like, okay?,A lot of the reasons that we,don't have political clout is,that by making ourselves,special, we separate ourselves out.,This person over here shouldn't,be special... more special than,this person.,Why should artists be singled,out as a class, as opposed to,any other class of people?,I think the answer is because,of what they contribute to the,aesthetic fabric of our society,,of our culture.,And I think that's very... very,,very important.,What is the title of,Manhattan Plaza now?,It's Manhattan Plaza: A Miracle,on 42nd Street.,A Miracle on 42nd Street.,A Miracle on 42nd.,Listen, this could have been,,you know, the biggest housing,project, okay?,And it could have been just,awful.,It could have been impersonal,,it could have been dirty.,The people that moved in,,they brought a new freshness and,an artistic quality to the,building, which I've never seen,anywhere else.,At Manhattan Plaza, what,happened was a fluke.,Out of something bad,came something very good.,It wasn't planned that way.,It just happened.,♪ Happy birthday to you,♪ Happy birthday,♪ Happy birthday to you,I always said that it was a,mixture of possibilities and,darkness, all right there.,And so you could choose the,darkness, or you could choose,the possibilities.,It's all your choice.,Artists create products...,artistic products.,If it's a play, if it's a piece,of sculpture, if it's a,painting, that goes into the,economic system of the country.,It's not like you have this real,economy out here that's,manufacturing things, and that's,the real economy.,And there are other people, over,here, doing ""art,"" which is,somehow peripheral or somehow...,you know, something elite.,Not, the arts are integrated,into the economy.,They're part of the real,economy.,Affordable housing can,actually be a growth generator,,as opposed to some sort of, you,know, drain on public services.,Then... Then Manhattan Plaza has,served a broader purpose.,At one time, this was the,neighborhood you were able to,find an apartment that was,affordable.,It's not that way anymore.,You stuck it out through the,tough years.,You made it wonderful for,everyone else.,And now, thank you very much,,your job is done, ""Ciao."",How much are those,apartments?,Across the street?,Yes.,It's gonna be expensive,,isn't it?,Yeah, oh, absolutely, it's,gonna be a luxury build.,That's what I'm talking about.,We're being threatened.,If they're paying a,million and a half dollars for a,studio across the street, we're,the undesirables.,The question as to whether or,not Manhattan Plaza will survive,and what the future holds for,Manhattan Plaza is one that,,of course, I've thought about,a lot.,What happens in the future?,Probably gonna be negotiated again.,I'd love to say things are,permanent, but there are very,,very few that are.,What could happen?,The federal government could,say, at some point in the,future, because they no longer,can afford to, possibly withdraw,the subsidy.,Some people call,Manhattan Plaza,the Miracle on 42nd Street, and,I couldn't agree with them more,,because the odds were totally,stacked against this ever,happening.,It's 30-something-odd year,later, and we're still a vibrant,community.,So, here we are, and my,mother was able to raise me in a,building that's a great,building, a nice building, a,good place to live.,So I think that is an amazing,concept, and I think that that,should happen more often in,places like this, you know, for,people like me to have an,opportunity.,I've had people come from all,over the country to,Manhattan Plaza.,They're looking for a blueprint.,There is no blueprint.,It's the people who manage and,operate and the people who live,here.,Manhattan plaza is the type of,place to live that has to be,duplicated throughout the major,cities in this country.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Miracle_on_42nd_Street-1822260

whole display,idea that was all hers.,- Can we make,gingerbread from scratch?,- Oh, bug, you know, I,think we better let Sam,,get back to his day.,- Well I have been meaning,to dig out that recipe,,family secret, now if I,teach you that recipe,,do you promise you won't,put it on the internet?,- I promise, promise.,- Promise.,Okay, let's bake.,You know, we should,probably get the roof on,before your mom eats,all the gum drops.,- She does that at home too.,- I do not, okay, I do.,- The icing's stuck.,- Okay, well try squeezing,it from the back,,like you do with toothpaste.,- I'll show you,Maggie, you got that?,- Okay, how do I?,- Oh, you're hands.,- Hello, the icing.,- I'm gonna let go, all,right, see what we got.,- All right, kitchen,is all yours,,just remember three hours,until the dinner crew rolls in,,cleared a shelf in,the walk-in for you.,- Oh, thanks man,,I'm gonna stick around,and test out some recipes.,- Why don't you cook,at your dad's house?,His kitchen is so nice.,- Well, I haven't,really told my family,,about my meeting,at the Butterfield.,- We'll have to keep it,quiet then won't we Soph?,- That means you too Charlie.,- Oh, I feel like I'm in Eloise.,- That's the Plaza mom,,look, there's dad and Kate.,- Hey, good to see you bug.,- Don't mind if I do.,- Fun day?,- We baked a gingerbread,house from scratch.,- Really?,- Yeah, it was,epic, where's Mia?,- Here she comes now.,- Thank you, thank you.,- For what sweetheart?,- For letting me,get my ears pierced,,Kate, helped me pick them out.,- Aren't they darling?,- You got your,ears pierced today?,- Yeah, dad said,you're okay with it.,- Well, she was so excited,,we figured no time,like the present.,- I was a little scared at first,but then it happened,so fast and it was done,and I have earrings.,- Oh, I'm gonna need,another one of those.,- Okay, the food in,this place is amazing,and I have never seen you,,turn down a tray of catering,brownies so what's up?,- Nothing.,- Nothing.,- It's just I was,planning on taking Mia,,to get her ears pierced myself,,it was gonna be my,big Christmas gift.,- I'm sorry, I had no idea,,why didn't you say so?,- I didn't think I had to,getting your ears pierced,is a mother, daughter,rite of passage,,it's right up there with,shopping for prom dresses,or watching Gilmore,Girls for the first time,,I have dibs on both,of those by the way.,- Yeah, I'm not gonna,watch Gilmore Girls.,- Okay, well maybe you,should tell Kate too,,just so there's no confusion.,- Understood.,- Sorry, I'm late,,what did I miss?,This is quite the production.,- The girls are having,the time of their lives.,- Oh, well, I mean,you think this is fun,,just wait till tomorrow,at the reindeer relay.,- The what now?,- A reindeer relay,it's like a decathlon,,where all the events,are Christmas themed.,- I don't remember seeing,that on the itinerary.,- Ah, Kate won't mind the add,,we used to do it every,year when we were kids,,the girls are gonna love,it, there's team events,,there's, there's trophies,,you are probably gonna,wanna save your energy,for the morning.,- Oh is that a fact?,- You know, Maggie's not,really into team sports,,I don't think anybody will,mind if you sit this one out,,that is if we even end up going.,- Oh yeah, it's happening.,Sam.,Nothing has,changed since I was a kid.,- So, listen there is,something I need to tell you,,I can't skate.,- Oh, well, that's a rethink.,- Oh, good, we're finally all,here, team Blitzen let's go.,- Good luck out there,,you're gonna need it.,- We don't need,luck we have Susan.,- It's gonna be fine.,- They're going to win for sure.,- Okay, team huddle up,,do you know what I see,,when I look at this team?,- Amateurs.,- No, I see underdogs,and you never wanna,underestimate the underdog,,it's like Rudolph the,red-nosed reindeer,,classic, classic,underdog, no friends,,wasn't allowed to play,in the reindeer games,,nobody ever thought old Rudy,was gonna lead Santa's sleigh,but there he is every Christmas,,leading those,reindeer to victory.,- I think what Sam,is trying to say,is we need to,believe in ourselves.,- Exactly, look no,one expects us to win,,so, no one can see us coming,now are you with me underdogs?,Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.,I'm gonna,help you get started.,- Come on, come on, come on.,- Oh, my god, stop, stop.,- It's all right, I got you,,you got it, you

this.,Hey,guys, wish me luck.,You can do it.,- Maggie, Maggie, Maggie,,Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie,,Maggie, Maggie,,Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.,Go, underdogs.,- That was incredible,,what a rush,,this is going on my nightstand.,- Is that where you,put all your trophies?,- This is my first one.,- Come on, that can't be true.,- Have you met me?,- Listen, I had an idea,about the pitch deck,,tell me if I'm way off base,but what if we included,small photos of my family,,to Butterfield, too cheesy?,- Not at all it's just,so sentimental of you,,I mean, two days ago you,were hiding the fact,,it was your family's,Inn from me.,- I don't think,hiding is accurate.,- I am just saying it's a shift.,- Well, I did practically,grow up there.,- I know and that's what makes,you so perfect for this job,,I mean, it's not just any,old restaurant to you.,- You know running that kitchen,it'll be like coming home.,Wow, that was cheesy.,- That was good like,,like goosebumps good.,I'm gonna write that down,,can I trust you with this?,- No, I will be careful.,- Very gentle.,- Typical Sam, swoops,in at the last minute,and steals my thunder.,- I know y'all take this,relay business seriously,but come on it's just a trophy.,- Hey, it's not,about the trophy,,he's got Maggie and the girls,wrapped around his finger,,did you see how much,fun they were having?,- To be honest I was busy,focusing on standing upright,but now you mentioned it.,- See, why can't I get,Maggie to laugh like that?,- Oh is this where,sore losers hang out,and lick their wounds?,- Surely you didn't come all,the way down here to gloat?,- No, just an unexpected bonus,,so, do you know where mom's,old photo albums might be?,- Try that box right there.,You remember this?,- Yeah, mom loved that star,,Dad bought it for their first,Christmas together, right?,- Yeah, this box is,full of old ornaments.,- Oh, look at this it's,from the year we won state,,I scored a goal in the first,period you were there right?,Mom looks so young there,,ah, Christmas isn't,the same without her.,- You know what I miss?,Her toffee.,- With the slivered,almonds on top.,- I follow her recipe every year,and it never turns out right,,she always made Christmas,so special, so warm.,how come when I try it it,winds up as an itinerary?,- Maybe stop trying so hard.,- Easy for you to say,Mr. flying from Tokyo,and make ginger,bread from scratch.,- Okay, you think dad,would wanna put up,,some of these decorations?,- They're mom's not Susan's.,- Yeah but these are,dad's memory, I mean,,they're ours too.,- Maybe it's hard on Susan,being reminded of dad's past.,- Is that what it's like for,you you know, Maggie around?,- Well, it's different Maggie,and Jeff are still family,,I mean, maybe not in,the conventional sense,but they're still very,much in each other's lives.,- And you're good with that?,- It's kind of a package deal.,And you are not helping either,,fanning the flames out on,the ice all Maggie, Maggie.,- Oh, come on, why?,I can't cheer on my team?,- Sam, you have got her,thinking that I'm the enemy,,I don't wanna be the enemy, I,wanna be part of her family.,- Try looking at things,from Maggie's perspective,,I mean, it can't be easy,having a front row seat,to the Jeff and Kate show.,Maybe she's just,trying to figure out,where she fits in too.,- It's open.,- Hey, what you working on?,- Oh, last minute,project for a client,,how's it going with the,operation woo the parents?,You and Ted looked pretty,chummy out there on the ice?,- Oh, well I could say the same,about you and chef Boyardee.,- He was just trying to,keep me from falling.,- Oh, come on, he's,totally into you,,every time I look over,you two are busy flirting.,- Okay, first of all,,we're not flirting,,we're making polite conversation,but even if we were,flirting which we're not,,how is that a problem?,- Well, he just doesn't,seem like the type of guy,,who wants to settle down.,- Really, who says I'm,looking for something serious?,Relax, there's no there, there.,- Hey, is this a bad time.,- No, come on in, you wanna,go check on the girls?,- No, they're fine,,Kate has them making,reindeer out of clothespins,,so, sounds like fun.,Sam, Sam, the man,what's happening?,- Not much just living.,- Seize the day am I right?,- Anyway, I was gonna,head down to Charlie's,,I just wanted to-,- Oh, please.,- Oh, this is cool.,- Did you bring,ornaments from home?,- I know, I know,it's overkill right,,it's just the girls and I,love decorating the tree,,it's one of our,favorite traditions.,- Yeah, it's mine too.,- Really, I thought all of,the Reynolds family trees,,were professionally done?,- Well, before my,dad married Susan,,we always decorated our own.,Yeah, Kate and I would,always fight over,,who got to hang,the first ornament.,- Me and Sophie, do that too.,- Who's Charlie?,You were saying that,,you were gonna head,over to Charlie's place?,- Charlie is a buddy,of mine in town,,yeah, I should probably,get going so talk later.,- If you want I,can talk to Kate,,see if you and the girls,could hang some of these out.,- Nah, kind of like having,them in here with me.,- I realize your,meeting is tomorrow,but can we talk about this later,perhaps when the sun is up?,- Oh no, no, no, no you don't,,come on you need to get dressed,,let's go we're taking the,girls on an adventure.,- Kate is taking them,snow tubing this morning,and I would rather not,mess with her plan.,- It's fine it doesn't,start until 10 okay,,we'll be back in plenty of time,,really, you always this,pokey in the morning?,- You think I'm slow?,good luck getting,my kids out of bed.,- Come on mom, let's go.,This is so cool.,Sophie look.,- Wow.,- We're not flying on one,of those planes, are we?,- Nope.,- Oh, thank goodness.,- That's our ride.,- Yeah, who's the,pilot Kris Kringle?,- Actually I am.,- Yeah, like you know,how to fly a helicopter?,You know, how to,fly a helicopter?,- Best view in town am I right?,- How much longer,till we head back?,- Well, we got to make,a quick pit stop first.,We're here to pick,out a Christmas tree.,- But you already have so many.,- Well, this is a special one,,this one's for your mom's,room so, she can hang,,all the special ornaments,she brought from home,,why don't you guys go,on ahead we'll catch up,,don't go too far though.,- Be careful.,- I hope this is okay, I,know you were talking about,,how much you guys love,decorating the tree,and it got me thinking.,- About helicopters?,- No, about Mia and Sophie,,they might be missing some,of their traditions too,,I mean, there's,also the added bonus,of seeing you in snow shoes.,- Okay coach, any pointers?,- Well, it's easy just put one,foot in front of the other.,Not bad.,- You know what they say never,underestimate the underdog.,- Whoa, what's going on in here,I am adding stocking hooks,,we need one for Sam of course,and Maggie brought hers from,home which was unexpected,,so, that is four more, I have,them perfectly spaced out,but I'm fine starting,over it is no big deal.,- You seem a little stressed.,- I was supposed to,take the girls out,,snow tubing this morning,but Maggie has them off,doing something else.,I'm pretty sure I,offended her again.,- Is it possible that she just,wanted to spend some time,,alone with her daughters?,- Do you think I'm overreacting?,- These things take time.,- I know, I know,,Maggie is such an important,part of the girls lives,and Jeff's too and sometimes,,I feel like I'm,crashing their party.,- Hey, they are,lucky to have you.,- I just wanted this,Christmas to be perfect,,like moms always were.,- Well, if it's any consolation,,I think you're doing,a wonderful job.,Now, let me help you,with these stockings.,- Okay, here.,- Daddy, look we chopped down,a tree in the real forest.,- Wow, another tree that's,what this place needs.,- Did we miss snow tubing?,- Yeah, I'm sorry kiddo,,the tickets were timed,,why don't you guys run,inside and get warm?,- Can we have a minute?,- Yeah, yeah, of course.,- You look mad, don't be mad,,I'm really sorry we were late,,cable release wasn't working,,when we tried to long,line the Christmas tree,,so, we had to call for back up.,- Do you even hear the words,coming out of your mouth?,- I know, right?,- Kate, was supposed,to take the girls,,snow tubing this morning but,you just up and disappeared.,- Nope, Hector,,knew where we were.,- Yeah, but I didn't, I'm,sitting at breakfast with Ted,,waiting for the girls,to come downstairs,and how do you think it looked,,me not knowing where,my own kids were?,- So, this is about Ted?,- And Kate, she,worked her butt off,,to make this trip,special for the girls,and all you have,to do was show up,and go along for the ride.,- Well, forgive me for wanting,,to spend a little,time with our kids,,she has them scheduled 24/7.,- Yeah, that's because Kate,is organized and responsible,,she doesn't just tag,along and create chaos.,- Me create chaos,,you're the one,,who wanted to change,things up this Christmas,,you said all of this in motion,and I will have you know,,I am quite capable,of making plans,,I planned to take Mia, to get,her ears pierced in Aspen,,I called ahead and,made an appointment.,- Again, with the earrings,,I told you it was,an honest mistake.,- That was my moment,to have not yours,and certainly not Kate's.,- Well, this was,supposed to be my moment,,my first vacation,with Kate's family,and your gumming up the works,,it's almost like you're trying,to screw things up for me.,- What?,I am only here because Kate,practically begged me to come.,- Oh, come on, you,jumped at the chance,and now you're running,around making googly eyes,with her brother.,- Googly eyes what am I 12?,- Look, I don't care what,you do on your own time,but this trip isn't about you,,it's about me and Kate,and the girls period.,- I have the deck to show,you if now's a good time.,- Yeah, now works,,show me what you got.,- You're sweaty.,- I am sweaty yeah, should,I just lose the shirt?,I mean, just right off,,I can just get rid,of it really easily.,- Can we stick to,business please.,- Yes, you got it.,- Okay, yeah, this,thing between us,,it is strictly professional,,like I would flirt with you,just to make things hard on him.,- For who for Jeff?,- He basically just accused,me of trying to undermine,,his relationship with Kate,and I have been nothing but,supportive, did I make a fuss,,when a photo I took of,Kate and Mia on Halloween,,wound up on Jeff's,Instagram feed,with the caption my two,boo's, no, I did not,because I am evolved and mature.,- And frustrated.,- So, very frustrated.,- You know, what,really helps that?,Smashing little rubber,balls against the wall,,come on, give a shot, I promise,you, you will feel better.,- This isn't gonna work.,Are you okay?,- It's all right, I've been,hit in the face much harder,,no offense, no.,- Does it hurt?,- Not really it's okay.,- How about I walk you,through the PowerPoint.,- Right now, right now?,- Yeah here.,Have a look.,- Wow, this is incredible,,I mean, it feels,like the Butterfield.,- Yeah, the woodwork,pattern from the lobby,is along the border.,- Wait did you switch,the order around?,- Yeah, I think it makes,more sense to hit them,with the personal connection,right from the top,,it just really draws them in,,especially with those,amazing photos you found.,But I can change it,back if you want.,- No, no, no, it's it's,much stronger this way,,it just kinda hit me you know,,I'm actually actually,pitching Butterfield tomorrow.,- You're gonna knock,it out of the park,but we should print,it out just in case.,- I think I know,the perfect place.,- This is crazy, what,if your dad walks in,and sees the deck?,- And I'll be right outside,keeping watch, it's okay.,- Everything okay?,- All good.,- How's it going,in there, you good?,- Whoa, again, all jumbled up.,- Wow, this looks so fun,can I borrow you for a sec?,- Yeah, we're a,little busy here.,- Trust me the jingle bell,crafting session can wait,,you are not gonna believe what,I just found in Ted's office,,he has a folder on you,,it's more like a dossier,,he has photos, a,background check.,- What were you doing,in Ted's office?,- Did you hear what I just said?,He had you investigated Jeff,as in private investigated,with a capital P and a capital,I, I mean, who does that?,Who are these people?,Do you think he has files,on all of Kate's boyfriends?,- Probably just the ones who,ask if they can marry her.,- You're getting married?,- If she says yes.,- Wow, that's huge.,Why didn't you say anything?,- I thought Kate should,be the first to know.,I'm gonna ask her,tomorrow night at dinner.,- You're proposing,on Christmas Eve?,- Whoa do you mind,keeping it down,,I'm trying to keep,it a secret here.,- Are you sure,that's a good idea,,just bringing it on the girls?,- Well, it's not like we,haven't talked about it before.,- What, you have when?,- A few weeks back, I,asked how they would feel,if Kate joined the family,,they were all for it.,Now can I get back to,my crafting please?,- Yeah, congratulations.,- Thank you.,- Yep, we're spending,Christmas Eve with dad and Kate,and you'll be back in time for,presents tomorrow, can I go?,Susan's letting me rearrange,the nativity scene.,- Okay, have fun.,Don't you wanna,reorder the wise men?,- I thought we were spending,Christmas Eve all together.,- I know sweet girl but,you're gonna have so much fun,,you're not even gonna,realize I was gone.,- Where will you go?,- I am gonna go downtown,,I booked a facial at,the St. Mark hotel,and then before you know,it we will all be together,,right by that tree.,- Actually, Santa visits,the tree in the great room,,I asked Hector.,- Oh, good thinking.,Come here, huggy,,kissy, see you later.,- Hey, hey, any chance,you'd be willing,,to listen to me,practice my pitch?,- I would love to but I,have an Uber driver coming,,oh, come on, Marty Zee, you too,,that's the third,driver to cancel on me.,- Yeah, it's the hill most,cars can't make it up,,I'm heading the,Butterfield in an hour,,I can give you a ride if,you're willing to wait.,- Thank you but I,think I'll keep trying.,- Yeah, don't wanna be,late for your facial.,- Word does travel,fast in this town?,- See, here's the thing,,I know for a fact you're,not getting a facial.,- Says who?,- Says Linda, the receptionist,at the St. Mark's day spa.,See, I called over there and,tried to sweet talk them,,into giving you a massage,,since clearly the last,thing you need is a facial.,Kate, says you're skipping,out on dinner too, true?,- Okay, look, I cannot,be at that dinner,,I need to get out of here now.,- It's okay, we'll figure it,out do you wanna talk about it?,- Jeff is asking Kate to,marry him at dinner tonight.,- Okay, wow.,- Yeah and I would rather not,be here to watch it go down.,- Wait, so you're gonna,spend Christmas Eve alone,in a town you don't know,not getting a facial?,- That's the plan.,- Okay, I'm coming with you.,- No but the Butterfield?,- It's fine I'll tell them,something important came up,,which is it's true by the way.,- No, I cannot let you do,this, this is your big shot,,your once in a lifetime.,- I'll reschedule, I can,change my flight if I need to.,Unless you wanna be alone.,- To be honest, I could,really use the company.,- Great, it's settled.,- Great.,Where should we go?,- Now, I know it's not a massage,but thought you might like it.,- This is gorgeous.,- It's a pool it's fed,by a natural hot spring,,lucky for us it's,closed for the night.,- And you just,happened to have a key?,- Wow, I know a guy.,- What's in the thermos?,- Mulled cider to,warm us up afterwards.,Come on, when's the next time,,you'll be at a natural hot,spring on Christmas Eve?,You're not gonna,make me go in alone.,Come on.,- Oh, fine.,Homemade cider, jazzy,Christmas vibes,,does this work on all the other,women you've brought here?,- Ah, wouldn't know,,never brought anyone here.,- Seriously?,- We used to come here when,I was a kid on Christmas Eve,,the cider is my mom's recipe,,technically you're not supposed,to bring drinks in here,but somehow she always,found a way to sneak it in.,- That's legitimately awesome.,- She was magic my,mom, she loved it here.,- I can see why, so peaceful.,- And then we would soak for,hours and sit by the fire,and wait for the,stars to come out.,My mom had this thing about,wishing on a North star,on Christmas Eve, she said,it was like birthday candles,,eyelashes and wishbones,all rolled into one.,- No pressure.,- Well, you know, for me,it was all about BMX bikes,and latest video,games but for my mom,,she always had the same wish,,she wished to be as,happy year around,as she was in that moment.,We stopped coming here,after my mom died,,I guess my dad thought,it'd be easier,,to start some new traditions.,- I gotta say this beats,caroling hands down,and you know how,much I love to sing.,- Can I ask you,something personal?,- Go ahead.,- Is the reason you didn't,wanna go to dinner tonight,because you're not over Jeff?,- No, no, not at all, we were,so young when we got married,,I never been in a real,relationship before,,you know how,everybody always says,,you should marry,your best friend,,thing is that that's,all we ever were,,we never had that thing.,- That thing is important.,- It is.,- You're sure you're over him?,- 100%.,- Well will it be okay if I.,- Was that your big move?,- Well, that,depends did it work?,Wow, best Christmas ever.,- Oh, that's my phone,I should get it.,- I'll get it, I'll get it.,It's Mia.,- Hey, is everything okay?,Wait, okay, slow down a sec,,no, of course, of course,I'll be right there,,that was Mia, she's at the,hotel St. Mark's looking for me.,- Ho, ho, ho and welcome,to the hotel St. Mark.,- Which way's the day spa?,- Mom.,- Maggie, Sam.,She was quite eager to,see you after dinner.,- I'm so sorry.,- Sam, I'll be right back,,I'm parked in a tow away zone.,- Thank you.,- You sure you're okay.,- Yeah.,- I'm gonna go call,your dad and Kate,and let them know,we're with you.,Don't go anywhere.,- I won't.,- Will you watch her?,- Big night huh?,You know, I remember,when my dad told me,,he was getting remarried,,a punch in the gut.,- Everything just,happened so fast,and everyone was looking at me.,- Like you're supposed,to jump for joy,and you just heard the,news five seconds before.,- Yeah, I mean I knew,it was coming eventually,but now it's real.,- Hard to process, I get it.,- Hey kiddo you okay?,- I'm sorry I left.,- That's okay, I'm just,glad you're all right.,- Mia and I are,gonna have a little,,one-on-one time in,my room, right kiddo.,- Oh, hey, I heard,you're marrying my,sister, congrats mate.,- Thanks, Sam, how did she,seem to you, Mia I mean?,- You know, a little,thrown off guard maybe,but I think that comes,with the territory.,- It's the first time,she's ever run away,,still counts as running,away if Hector told us,,where he was taking her right?,- You know, when I found out,my dad was proposing to Susan,,I hopped on a flight to,Bangkok and spent a month,,sweeping floors in a,Buddhist monastery,,those monks taught me,everything I know about curry,,I guess what I'm,saying is just be glad,,she only made as far as the spa.,- Yeah, man you make,your own Thai food,is there anything you don't do?,- You look hungry come on,,I'll make you something to eat.,- You have to promise me,the next time you're upset,,you won't run away?,- But you did.,- That's different,,your dad and Kate are,starting a new life together,,I wanted to give,them some space,,let them have their,special moment.,And to be honest I didn't think,it would be that much fun,,watching him propose,to someone else.,- Yeah, it really wasn't.,- Oh, babe I'm sorry, I,thought you'd be excited,,you like Kate don't you?,- Yeah but she's not you,,I mean, I like our life,,I like how we do Christmas.,- I know, change is hard,and you have had so,much of it lately,,new school, new,friends, new crushes.,- Mom.,- You have been such a,trooper through all of it,,that's why I changed my,mind about the earrings,,I realized that the reason,I was holding on so tight,was because deep down I,didn't want things to change,,if I had my way you would,stay my little girl forever,,but you've already become,this smart and funny,,fiercely independent,young woman.,I think it's time for,me to start letting go.,- Maybe don't let go just yet.,- I love you.,- I love you too.,Can I come in?,These are for Santa but I,think we need them more.,- I think you're right,come sit with us.,Hey, I want you two to know,,that I am really,happy for your dad,and I think Kate is,pretty terrific too.,- You do, since when?,- Let's just say,I'm working on it.,I know just the,thing to cheer us up,,look who came to Aspen.,- Sir Santa-Lot.,- Sir Santa-Lot.,- I thought he,might come in handy.,- So, this is where,the party's at,,I found these in the basement.,- Oh, ornaments.,- They are the ones we used,to hang when we were kids.,- How come you don't hang,them on one of your trees now?,- You know, that is a very,good question and I think,,I'm gonna have a chat with,my dad and Susan about that,but in the meantime I thought,we could hang out with yours?,If that's okay?,- Yeah, get them on the tree,,so, any word from,the Butterfield?,- It turns out the owners are,flying out tomorrow night,,so, might have missed my chance.,- Oh no, I am so sorry.,- No, no, I'm not.,You know, this is,the first time,,I've been home for,Christmas in years,,with my mom gone guess I didn't,feel like I fit in anymore,but this time around,feels different.,- I'm happy you're here.,- Me too.,Plus now I'm not the only,Christmas crasher so that helps.,Mom, look at,this, got to see this.,- Is that you?,- Oh, no, no, that's going,back in the basement,,come here, let me have,that, oh, it's so cute.,- Oh, Kate, one of Santa's,elves left these gifts,,by the wrong tree, I won't be,a minute, how are you doing?,- Oh, you know, just,hanging out by the tree,,wondering what I did to,make a 12 year old run away.,- Mia's crazy about you,,you know that right?,- I thought we were,getting along so well,,until Jeff proposed.,- I'll admit it,was a bold choice,,asking you in front of everyone,,it shows a certain confidence.,Here's what I have learned,about being a stepmother,,it is not a competition,,Maggie, will always be,Mia and Sophie's mom,and all you have to do is,be your wonderful self,,Mia will come around eventually.,- You really think so.,- I know so.,- Are those for,tomorrow morning?,- Yeah, Mia, said,something about,,missing the cinnamon,rolls in Austin.,- You know, I'm not,one to give you advice,,about your love life, I,tend to think it's best,,to let you figure these,things out on your

rules.,And I expect that every,guest in this hotel,,Has to follow them.,Now, in this side, is for women.,And on this other side,,that one, is for men.,And remember, no peeping allowed.,And you must

living like,royalty the rest of our days.,(Howling),Why, Gringo, I understand that you,And the German are going after gold.,If so, I think it would be,smart of you to tell me.,Otherwise, you know what can happen.,We told you, we're going hunting.,Yeah, and we paid a lot of money for,All of this crap, so I,don't think we have to,Answer to any more questions, do we?,It is my duty to find,out about any foreigners,,Adventurer, pirate, or leech,who enters into my country,,What they intend to do.,There are thiefs who would,steal natural richness,,So you must understand,that I have the right,To confiscate everything,that's not declared.,So good luck to you, my friends.,Don't worry.,All we're gonna do is hunt.,Do anything you want in that jungle.,You can tear your eyes out.,But if you find

But I'd like to kind,to hear from the physicist, Jack.,All right, I'm sorry.,Please continue.,Well, you're right in a way, Mr...,Jack, call me Jack.,O.K., Jack.,You're right in a sense.,But it wasn't always so,,not before Descartes.,When he introduced such thinking...,it amounted to a revolutionary,break with the church.,He said ""I don't need the Pope to,tell me how the world functions...,I can find that out for myself,,because to me the world is just a machine."",And then he became fascinated,with clockworks...,and made the clock into,his central metaphor.,He said ""I consider the human body,as nothing but a machine...,A healthy man is like a well-made clock.,A sick man is like an ill-made clock."",The metaphor seems a little clumsy now.,But it worked, didn't it?,Yes, so successfully, that,scientists came to believe...,that all living things, plants,animals, us, are nothig but machines.,And that's the fallacy.

I'd like to get,back to the systems.,-You know, you called me dishonest.,-Oh, no, no, no...,Let's talk about the gallbladder again.,Let's say the gallbladder's out,and the pain is gone...,...but what about the stress that,might have caused the illness?,If that stress persists he's probably,going to get sick again.,Or let's say he had,changed his nutrition...,...much earlier, and,done some exercise.,He may never have developed,the gallstones in the first place.,A little health education,might have been...,...much cheaper that the operation,,a lot less painful, too.,But our system doesn't,encourage prevention...,...it encourages intervention.,O.K. You're not disingenuous, but to,blame all this on french philosopher...,...who's been dead 300 years, isn't,that a little out of proportion...,...maybe even all a little eccentric?,No. Not if I'm right.,See, my point isn't to,condemn Descartes' thinking.,It's simply to recognize its limitations.,It might have been extremely,useful to perceive the world...,...as a machine for 300 years,but that perception today...,...is not only inaccurate,,it's actually harmful.,We need a new vision of the world.,What's that quotation?,""It's foolish for a society to try to,cling to its old ideas in new times...,...just as it's foolish for a grown,man to try to squeeze...,...into the coat that fit him in his youth."",Something like that...,Thomas Jefferson.,Maybe you're not crazy.,I don't know, Sonia.

My specialty was lasers.,At that time, the challenge was to design,lasers of ever-shorter wavelengths.,The shorter the wavelength,,the more powerful the laser.,Our ultimate goal was to,create an x-ray laser.,One day I hit upon an unusual,idea which, as it turned out...,...led to a major advance,in that x-ray laser.,Well, when you do something like that,,science treats you very well.,I got many attractive offers...,First from Paris and then from,the States and I took them.,Finally working quite happily,in Boston until one day...,I discovered, totally unexpectedly,,that my work was being perverted.,I had always looked at the medical,applications of my work of using...,...this laser to provide holographic,images of cells or even molecules.,It could have helped us solve so many,puzzles, even the formation of cancer cells.,But what really happened was that a more,sophisticated version of my idea was...,...being used in the star wars,program, and it blew my mind.,It... it made me re-evaluate,my whole profession.,Anyway, to cut it short...,...in the midst of other events,I just got up and left.,What were the other,events, if I may ask?,Experiences not all that different,from yours, I suppose.,I left Boston and,eventually I came here.,I just came one day from Paris,and the place took hold of me.,I kept coming back.,There were weeks when the,storms chased the tourists away...,...and I had this place all to myself.,I started to look at how my special,knowledge of subatomic physics...,...relates to the way I,perceive the world at large.,I don't know, but I think that I'll have,something to say after my time here.,I don't know yet if it will fit,into a coherent whole.,But it's what I ponder when I,take my morning walks, which...,...today, for some reason,,brought me to you two.,See, every morning, I walk,across the island regardless...,...of the weather trying to,understand its other language.,The stones speak, and I'm silent.,Something like that, yes.,That's from a poem, isn't it?,Well, maybe, I don't know.

I thought it meant,map-like, like a map.,- You thought it meant like ""a la carte"".,- Yes, like a menu.,Then his name would,have been Menusian.,I'd like to offer this ecological way of,thinking as a new way of looking at things.,Help us overcome this,crisis of perception.,See, what I've found here is that,to think in an ecological way...,...simply makes more sense of everything.,It gives me a much firmer grasp,of reality. It gives me strength.,Knowledge is power?,Yes, but in the sense of,personal empowerment.,Not that old male urge,for power over others.,Descartes' evil empire again?,Descartes had a dream.,It was really Isaac Newton who,made that dream come true.,Who transformed it into,scientific theory, into power.,""May God us keep from single vision,and Newton's sleep."" William Blake.,- I'm very impressed.,- You two would have a lot in common.,He was writing in poetry 200 years ago,what you're saying today in prose.,He hated Newton's,concept of single vision.,He dedicated his entire life to making,art that denied single vision.,Of course, the people of his,time thought he was a crank.,Whereas they revered,Newton almost as a god.,By reducing all physical phenomena,to the motion of material particles...,...a motion caused by the force of gravity,,he was able to describe the exact...,...effect of gravity on any object,with precise mathematical equations.,We call it Newton's laws of motion...,...really, the great achievement,of 17th century science.,You mean all that stuff I slept through,in high school, that square root of...,...the hypotenuse divided,by a pinch of magnesium?,Well, in the right hands, or,should I say, aroused minds...,...these equations seems,to work beautifully.,I could use Newton's equations,to calculate and explain...,...every motion of that throw, from the,ballistic curve to the ripples in the water.,This was a feat so impressive,for the time that Newton's...,...mathematical system,immediately established itself as...,...The correct theory of reality,,the ultimate laws of nature.,Descartes' dream of the world,as a perfect machine...,...was now an established fact.,It brought with it such a,wealth of benefits for people.,People could do things they,never been able to do before.,It was irresistible, and of,course, the old notions of...,...the world as a living,organism was swept away.,So, what's wrong with Newton?,Kit.,Well, this is my daughter,Kit and her friend Roman.,Kit, this is Thomas Harriman.,- How you do?,- And this is Jack, uh--,- Jack Edwards.,- Yeah, Jack Edwards. Hi.,What do you think of this new,ecological view of your mother's?,It's O.K.,Kit is utterly bored,hearing me talk about it.,Yeah, well... We're going,to go. Nice to meet you.,Yes, nice meeting you.,- Have fun.,- See you later.,Well, so she's living here with you?,No, she's in her first year in,college, she's on a break.,But right now, yes, I think she's,utterly bored living here with me.,I understand that.,I have two of my own.,Yeah, I had--,I mean I have one.,You know, it's no accident,that Turner painted light...,...when he did or that light became,the inspiration of the impressionists.,The nature of light became an,obsession with the physicists, too.,See, none of them could visualize how,the light of the sun reached the earth.,Why?,What is nature of light?,To understand the nature of light, you,have to know what matter is made of.,I thought it was made of atoms.,What's an atom? Newton,thought it was small, solid particles.,But that's not what scientists saw when,they observed atoms for the first time.,What they saw was totally,unexpected and shocking.,You mean, when they discovered atoms,were made up of even smaller particles...,...a nucleus with electrons,whirling around it?,Not only that. They were moving in,relatively vast regions of empty space.,That's what shook the scientists up.,Atoms consist mainly of empty space.,What's that mean, vast regions of,empty space? Atoms are tiny.,Yes, they are, this is what's,so hard to visualize.,See, the size of atoms is so far removed,from our ordinary sense of scale and...,...proportion that it's extremely hard,to get a feeling for the relative...,...sizes and distances of their particles.,Ask yourself, how many atoms,are there in an orange?,To answer this, you'll have to,blow up the orange to a size...,...where you can actually see the atoms.,You'll have to blow up the orange,until it's reached the size of the earth.,The atoms inside of it will then,be the size of cherries.,Myriads of cherries tightly packed,into an orange the size of earth.,Wow, what an image!,I'm serious.,I was trying to shrink the earth,orange back to a real orange and...,...imagine all those cherries,whizzing around, it made me dizzy.,This is a dangerous,height to be dizzy at.,But O.K.

Let me get this straight.,You measure and the electron is,there, it shows up, like Tom said.,But in between measurements,,you can't say for sure that it's...,...in a definite place or,even that it went on...,...a definite path from,one place to another.,So how does it go from here to there?,It moves, doesn't it?,No.,- You mean it stays in the same place?,- No.,Either the electron moves,,or it doesn't move.,Well, you can't say that.,Well, are you getting a feeling now,of what these physicists felt?,You see, an electron doesn't,move from place to place.,And it doesn't stay in,one place, either.,It manifests itself as probability,patterns spread out in space.,And the shape of these probability,patterns changes with time...,...something which might seem like,movement to human perception.,Are you saying that the electron,gets smeared out over a large...,...region and then when you measure,it with the measuring gun...,...it collapses into a small point?,You got it.,All subatomic particles,,electrons, protons, neutrons...,...manifest this strange existence,between potentiality and reality.,So at the subatomic level,,there are no solid objects.,No, there are not.,Well, if there are no solid objects,at the subatomic level...,...how are there solid,objects at any level?,That's the amazing thing.,This simple question, what,makes this rock so solid?,...goes way beyond our,power of imagination.,I mean, I cannot explain,this to you in visual terms.,Of course I can do it in,mathematical equations...,...but there's no metaphor for it.,How can you live in a,world that's unmetaphorical?,I mean, you have to,perceive reality in some way.,I mean, this is solid.,O.K.,Let's take an atom from,within this granite...,...the silicon atom with,its 14 electrons.,The probability patterns of these,electrons arrange themselves...,...like shells around the nucleus,,each shell containing several electrons.,Within the shells the electrons are,every where at the same time...,...so to speak, but the probability,patterns that resemble shells...,...are extremely stable and,very hard to compress.,Matter is solid because probability,patterns are difficult to compress?,That's as good as it gets.,So I was right to sleep,through Mr. Gides' physic class...,...that model he made me out,of tinker toys with sticks...,- ...and balls that was wrong, right?,- Right, wrong.,Yeah, it's a lousy visualization,,but then, no one did it any better.,""If the doors of perception were,cleansed everything would...,...appear as it is, infinite."",William Blake.,So, Sonia, life's a bunch of,probability patterns running around.,- Probability patterns of what?,- Of interconnections.,What?,Well, what I'm trying to say is,that this probabilities are not...,...probabilities of things, but,probabilities of interconnections.,See, Jack. That's what,she was trying to tell you.,See, we tend to think of subatomic,particles are some kind of small...,...billiards balls or small grains of sand.,But for physicists a particle,has no independent existence.,A particle is essentially a,set of relations that reach...,...outward to connect,with other things.,What are those other,things, please?,They're interconnections of,yet other things which also...,...turn out to be interconnections,,and so on, and so on.,In atomic physics we never,end up with any things at all.,The essential nature of matter lies,not in objects, but in interconnections.,Everybody knows the chord, it's a,third, the most basic of harmonies.,It carries with it a very,distinctive feeling, no?,And yet it's individual notes,carry none of that feeling.,Therefore, the essence of,the chord lies in its--,Lies in relationships.,And then the relationship,between time and pitch...,- Makes melody.,- Makes melody.,- Relationships make music.,- Relationships make matter.,- Music of the spheres.,- As Kepler said.,- And Shakespeare before him.,- And Pythagoras before him.,Now, this vision of the universe,arranged in harmonies of...,...sounds and relations,is no new discovery.,Today, physicists are simply proving,that what we call an object...,...an atom, a molecule, a particle,,is only an approximation, a metaphor.,At the subatomic level, it,dissolves into a series of...,...interconnections like chords,of music. It's beautiful.,Yeah, but there are,boundaries, aren't there?,I mean, between you,and me, for instance.,We are two separate bodies, aren't,we? That's not an illusion. Is it?,Are you saying that there,is a physical connection...,...between you and me, and,you and the wall behind you...,- ...and the air and this bench?,- Yes.,At the subatomic level there,is a continual exchange of...,...matter and energy between,my hand and this wood...,...between the wood and the air,,and even between you and me.,I mean a real exchange of,photons and electrons.,Ultimately, whether,we like it or not...,...we're all part of one,inseparable web of relationships.,- How does all this explain light?,- Yes, finally, light.,Light doesn't need a medium,because although it...,...travels in waves, it also,travels as particles.,Light is both particles and waves?,Yes, but the particles of light,,which we call photons...,...are of a very special kind.,Unlike other particles,,they never stands still.,They never speed up,,they never slow down.,They always travel at the same,speed.

Anna.,I want cinematography here.,Drop.,Recording.,Good day, everybody.,Time here is,approaching 10:00 AM,,welcome to our extreme,weather experiment.,The device that we're about to,launch into this tornado which,is currently registering,at an EF1 level,uses electromagnetic pulses,and emits chemical adjusters,that can shift the balance,of warm and cold air and form,malleable pockets.,You want to try one in English,for our less scientific viewers,to understand, boss.,Which means we can,enhance the energy,building inside this thing,and we can manipulate.,In theory we can make it,bigger and there's also,another possibility.,It's close.,Hey, doc, we're going to have,to get this thing in there soon,,man, I'm having trouble,holding it in position.,It needs to go right in,the middle of the twister,right now.,Right, It's arcing now, you need,to hit it side on, OK, it'll,penetrate better.,That's what she said.,Oh, well, Greg focus.,Bad joke.,OK, let's move.,Come on.,Hey, guys, no

bitch.,Yeah.,Great shot, now activate it.,Oh, my god, we're active.,Calibrating the formation,and the gas composition.,I'm reading speed,,size, and velocity.,Hey I'm activating the,chemical and electrical pulses,,the particles expanding.,The rope formation,is spiraling faster,and amalgamate even more gases.,What does that mean?,It means the son of a,bitch is getting bigger.,It had to be wise.,Did you ever doubt it?,Oh, with in church.,Not for a second.,This is great.,I'm going to intensify it.,No, Greg, no.,What?,Devlin, it works tell,him to shut it down.,Oh, man, this is beautiful.,Whoa.,Oh, my god.,It's all turning shape,,it's intensifying rapidly.,She's right.,It's a cone formation.,We're officially category grade.,Devlin!,Devlin!,OK, yeah, Greg, shut,it down, that's enough.,I can make it bigger,,we could go further.,We've worked too hard,for too long, man.,Let's go further.,Shut it down, Greg,,it's dangerous.,I got control of it.,Yeah, I think,actually I can push it,away by altering the,magnetic balance.,Come on.,Don't get so close.,Greg, stop.,Stop.,Currently 4, Greg shut it down.,Fine, just give me a minute.,It's not responding.,Charging against,,increasing in size.,What?,It's exploding and moving.,It's going to head to us.,When?,About 30 seconds.,We got to run.,Greg, it doesn't mean anything.,In 30 seconds, we need to run.,I can't do

beat it.,No, no, no, no.,There's got to be a,way to stop it, right?,Why couldn't he,have just listened?,Why didn't we-- we tried,to tell him to stop.,We tried to warn him.,Maybe we shouldn't have,played God in the first place.,No.,We mustn't forget the,reasons for doing this.,Greg wanted it too.,No, we can still fix this.,We can still make this right.,Helen.,What?,Keep track of the,speed and the course.,I'm going to try,and get ahead of it.,Come on, you rusty,piece of shit.,Come in.,Come on.,Relax.,Yes, boss?,Yes, Thomas.,Well, I've noticed we've had,some inclement weather today.,Yeah, it's a bit windy.,A bit windy.,OK.,What is that?,Weather coverage up to date.,And this here, in the,middle of the screen,,passing across the,west of the country,is a force four tornado.,Force four, is that a lot?,Christ, Thomas, no.,Out of 5.,And it's increasing,intensity too.,This is already the,most powerful tornado,to hit these shores.,It's missing all the,major cities thankfully.,I don't understand.,What's this got to do with us?,Around this area here is a,country house currently being,rented by one Pierce Moore.,Never heard of him.,Well, you wouldn't have.,He's an accountant.,But he works for Tony Markwell.,Oh, I've heard of him.,Moore's got pretty,simple Joe Brady.,He takes in launder,money in big stashes,and oversees it until he's,curried on to deals, et cetera.,There's money awaiting, boys.,And then there's small,security team and an accountant,protecting him.,So this guy must get,robbed all the time.,Would you rob anything,from Markwell?,Well, no, but--,Technically, but we have,a window here, boys.,This tornado is going to,pass close to his place,in about two hours.,We can get there in 90,minutes, by which time,if he's got any sense,,him and his security team,would have evacuated,to the nearest town,or bowled themselves in the,basement, if there is one.,You want to rip him off?,That can be anywhere between,a quarter and 3/4 of a million,in stash there.,And that's just one,stash he has too.,So how many guards do they have?,At least two.,Maybe more.,What about the security system?,That's the beauty of it.,We can cut communication,and power to the whole area.,And they'll just put,it down to the twister.,We get in.,And we get out.,And we will have what,is known in the traders,,plausible deniability.,Are you boys game?,I'm in.,I'm not sure, boss.,That was a rhetorical,question, Tommy.,You come in now.,Tool up, you slugs.,We're going treasure hunting.,Come on, fuck off.,I think I've made,a breakthrough.,OK.,What have you got?,Right.,OK.,Just take the next left.,And then we need to get within,500 meters of the tornado.,Is that even safe?,Oh, yeah, don't worry.,I'm on it.,We'll be safe to,about 400 yards.,But that is until it,intensifies again.,OK.,So what do we do?,Well, I'll have made,some adjustments.,And I think I can hone in on,the TIU's directional system.,You can retrieve it?,Of course.,Well done, Helena.,No, we don't retrieve it,now but we can use it.,How?,I use steering wheel.,You can drive that thing?,In a manner of speaking, we,can slowly pull the off-back,and still be going inland.,Hopefully, she'll go out to sea.,Great, great.,Let's do that.,There's a problem.,Well, the trajectory,you set it on,,it's going to take it straight,through several houses.,Well, they were close.,Surely they would,have evacuated.,Not necessarily.,If this thing goes straight,over a country house,,it'll destroy it in a moment.,If the power intensifies,,it'll strip out a basement.,Well, then we get ahead of,this thing, and we warn them.,OK.,Let's do this.,Oh, shit.,Give it a heads-up,next time, Doc.,Yeah, sorry.,It's all right.,All right.,We got to go back on track.,I

Worlds Apart (2015) - full transcript,"Against the backdrop of restless Athens, Greece, three stories of intercultural romance intertwine, depicting the turmoil and the inner sadness of a country trapped in a ceaseless socio-economic collapse. As a seemingly endless wave of fervent nationalism spreads in town, Farris, a Syrian refugee, saves Daphne, an idealist college student. Then, Yorgos, an unhappily married, pill-popping sales manager, has an unexpected affair with Elise, a frigidly beautiful Scandinavian corporate executive. Finally, Maria, a wistful Greek housewife whose family is struggling to keep afloat, has a chance encounter with grizzled Sebastian, who offers her a second chance in love.

Great.,Great coffee, by the way.,- Thanks.,- Well, I just wanted to,get that on the record.,Anyway, um,,tell me everything that,happened last night,or at least everything you can,remember.,- Sure.,Like I told Sonny, I was,watching a movie,,and I heard a dog barking next,door.,Didn't think much of it.,And then there was a scream,afterwards.,Huh, that's when I got up,to see what was going on.,- And how long was that dog,barking,before you heard the scream?,- I don't know, TV was on,,I didn't really notice at first.,- Yeah, so at what point did you,get up,to go check it out and was it,before or after the scream?,- After. I turned the TV,off and went to the door.,- And could you still hear,the screaming at the door?,- No, no. It stopped by then.,I called 911.,- Hmm. What'd you think it was?,- Oh, I assumed it was Mrs.,Stirgard.,- You heard the dog,barking and then a scream,that sounded like Mrs. Stirgard,,but you didn't go over,there to check it out?,- It would've been safer not to.,- For who?,- What are you driving at?,- Oh, no, no, no.,Hey, look, I'm just trying to,get a picture here, you know?,I mean, you like the woman, she,was nice,,and why not just go over and try,to lend a helping hand,if she's in trouble?,It just seems a little, a little,cold.,That's all.,- Okay, okay, look, I,just...,Last spring,,I heard that you dug out Dave,Harper,after his truck slid off,the road into the gully,after all the rain that we had.,So this, I don't know, this,just doesn't seem like you.,You know, I mean, I've gotta,believe your first instinct,was to go over there and help.,- It was, actually.,- So why didn't you?,- I heard something.,- After the scream?,- Yeah, it was, it was,like an animal sound.,- An animal sound. Wha-Wha-What,kind?,- I, I don't know.,It wasn't like any sound,I'd ever heard before.,- Was it a growl like a bear?,- Not exactly, it...,Well, I don't know if I could,identify,a bear from this distance,anyway,,but it wasn't like any bear,I'd ever heard.,- All right. Well, can you,describe what it sounded like?,- Well, it had a kind of a hiss.,- A hiss, like a snake?,- No, no, I, I know this sounds,weird,,but I don't know how else to,describe it.,It was loud even over here,and, and it was like a roar,,but there was a definite hiss to,it.,- And that scared you,enough to call the police?,- Yeah.,- Did you hear anything,else after the hiss?,- No, but I didn't go outside,until the police showed up.,- Did you tell Sonny that?,- Yeah. I told him I,heard an animal noise.,He didn't ask any further.,- What do you wanna do?,- Huh.,Let's give it a bit to cool,down.,I wanna check out the,woods behind Helen's.,See if we can find another hole.,- Max, we've been back and forth,across her yard now for two,hours.,- We'll find it. We haven't,been this far out yet.,- Bottom line,is I just don't wanna be,out here chasing our tails.,What? Why are you stopping?,- Another coincidence.,- Holy-,- Shit.,- Tracks everywhere.,Here, you start around the other,side.,- Okay.,Well they appear to be,the same anyway, that's good.,I wonder if...,- What?,Wonder if what?,What the fuck is it, Max?,Okay,,have a nice weekend, bye-bye.,- Okay.,And?,That's fine.,Hey, hey, where are you going?,- Hey, I have some faxes,coming in for Doug Bradley.,- $8.47.,- Um, sorry, what?,- $8.47.,- Uh...,Keep the change. Thanks.,You have got to see this.,- Reptilian? Like a lizard?,- Apparently.,- Well, I don't know,how I feel about that.,- What the hell is this thing?,Where did it come from?,- I don't know,,but just as important,,how long has it been here?,Come here. You gotta look at,this.,Okay.,So I went through most of the,local papers,from the surrounding counties,,and I found,a number of suspicious,or at least,what I deemed to be suspicious,attacks.,Take a look at these dates.,Backward from this,year.,So in October of 2017,,two people were killed in Knox,County.,In September of the same,year, there's one on Kennebec.,Then another in Cumberland,in November of 2016.,Till we move back to October of,2013,,where five people were killed,between Oxford and Franklin,County.,Now each time this seems to be,happening,in either September, October, or,November,,Other than a few rare attacks in,December,,they completely stop after that.,I mean, I don't know,why, but it's gotta be,some kind of pattern, it's gotta,be.,I traced it back to,1958, for Christ's sake.,- How could this not be noticed?,I mean, there has to be,something.,- If there is, no one's,ever said anything,,and there's never been a living,witness.,- What about this guy,Dobson? What's his deal?,I mean, his dog gets,killed near his house,,he hears it, but sees nothing?,- I thought the same,thing.,I looked him up. Clint,Dobson, he's over in Otis,,tried calling him on,whatever number I could find,,but disconnected.,- Let's take a ride.,So you said there was a pattern?,Well, what's the pattern?,- The counties.,See, I started with the most,recent,and I worked my way back.,The original idea was to,try to find a kind of hotbed,for where most of the attacks,occurred,,but when I started to mark off,each one,,something else happened.,- I see a bunch of circles.,- Mm-hmm.,Those are migration patterns.,- But how can that be?,- I don't know.,That's what we're gonna find,out.,- Have you ever heard,of a creature that has,this kind of migration cycle?,- No, but I'm far from an,expert.,- It looks like each fall,,it moves on to a new location.,- Mm-hmm.,- And it sets up shop,,attacking, one, two, three,,five times.,- Yep. Keep going.,- And then by the time,it circles back around,to the original spot, it's,like seven to 10 years later.,So it has a clean slate at that,point.,Jesus.,- Welcome to the dark side.,- Max.,- Um, excuse me.,Excuse me!,- Oh my God.,You scared me.,- Sorry about that.,Uh, do you live here?,- I do. What can I do for you?,- We're looking for a Clint,Dobson.,Does he still live here?,- I'm afraid you're a little,late.,He passed a few years back.,I'm his daughter, Marie.,- Oh, I see, uh,,I'm Max, and this is Harriet.,- I'm sorry for your loss.,- Don't be. He was an asshole.,- What about your mother?,Is she still around?,- No, she had even less of a,tolerance,for his bullshit than I did.,She left a long time ago.,What is this about?,- Oh, we're from the Trenton,Record.,Uh, we had wanted to,ask him some questions,about when his dog was attacked,and killed a while back.,- You mean Blackie?,You , you came over,from Trenton,to ask about that?,Why do you wanna know?,- Did he ever say anything about,it?,You know, anything about that,night?,- Not to me.,I was away at school at the,time.,I swear, he,loved that dog more than us,,but as you can imagine, we,weren't,on the best of terms at that,time.,So I didn't talk to him much.,I know there's a, there's a,fence,back in there somewhere because,of it.,- Uh, any brothers or sisters,who might have been around?,- I have an older brother in,California,,but he was gone by then too.,- What about any friends he,might have told or you know,,journals he might have had?,- You kidding?,My father could hold up his,beer bottle and not much else.,- Okay, well, it was worth a,shot.,Thanks for your time, Marie.,We won't take up any more of it.,- Thanks again.,Actually, wait.,You know, at the end he,,he was pretty out of it,with the drugs and everything.,He kept slipping in and out of,time.,And one day he started,talking about Blackie.,He kept going on and on,about the hiss getting him.,Something like that.,We all just thought he,was talking nonsense, but,there was something,about the way he said it,that it really stuck with me.,The hiss.,He kept repeating it.,Scared me a little.,Uh, is that anything?,- It actually is.,Thank you again.,- Thanks.,Okay. I can't believe I'm,saying this, but I'm in.,The problem is I just,can't wrap my brain around,the whole season thing.,What is it about the months of,October,and November that bring it out?,Why is it so active during those,times?,- I know, that is a big one.,- We have to get Bill involved,now.,- Are you kidding me?,All we have now are theories.,Bill's way past that.,- We need the help.,Not, not to mention, he's gonna,want something soon anyway.,You can't keep this secret,from him much longer.,- Oh, I know.,I'm just gonna have to,get crafty,,but, hey, that's my game.,- I think you should play,dumb, that's really your game.,- Uh-huh. Uh-huh-huh-huh.,Well, look who found a sense of,humor.,Hey, I taught you well.,- Oh, glad you could,take credit for that too.,So now what?,- Well there's still a bunch of,stuff,I gotta get through tonight, but,tomorrow,,I mean, we need to find out,everything,we can about reptiles.,Maybe that'll least,send us in a direction,,but you know, my,Internet's been backing up,,so let's go to your place.,- I can't tomorrow.,Bill assigned me to the,Beauregard job.,- The dog show?,- Pays, yes. A gig's a gig.,I ought to use my camera for,something,that actually brings in money.,- I can't believe I'm getting,usurped,by a bunch of animals,that eat their own shit.,- Hey, there will also be dogs,there.,Relax. I should be out by two,,the latest.,- All right, well then meet,me at the library, I guess.,I'll use the computers there.,It looks like I'll be getting,my mail there for a bit.,- Hmm. Fair enough.,What stuff do you have to go,over tonight?,- Uh, well, I need to go,over your photos more,,and then there's some articles,I haven't even touched yet.,Why?,- Take a break? Head over,to Millie's for a drink?,- You buying?,- Damn, this story better pan,out.,- Hmm.,- Seriously. You're a great,journalist.,So why are you freelancing,for this shitty-ass paper?,You should be in staff,in Boston or New York.,- Mm, no.,I would never ever work for a,paper,that covers the Yankees, you,know that.,Hey, can I have another?,- Jesus Christ.,Can't you be serious for,a second.,- You ever work in a factory,,Harry?,- What?,- Well my dad did.,He managed a hack and slash unit,there.,- I have no idea what you just,said.,- Selective,deforestation is what they call,it.,- Okay. So what does that,have to do with anything?,- Uh, my dad died on the job.,- I didn't know that. I'm sorry.,- Who knew that's what slaving,away,at a job for 32 years gets you?,You know, one minute,you're working your ass off,50, 60, 70 hours a week,outta some half-cocked notion,to send your son to college and,the next,,well, the next you're not.,- Half-cocked? That's,a pretty good reason.,- Oh my God. It's just such,a fucking waste of life.,- You can't look at it like,that.,- Well, maybe not, but I do,anyway.,Yeah, it made me realize,how fragile everything was.,How you can't assume,anything and the thought,of going down that same path,was so goddamn suffocating.,I mean, you didn't grow up here,,right?,I mean, you don't realize,how bad it can get.,That wasn't gonna happen to me.,No.,I was gonna take my,shots, wherever that led.,No nets, no regrets.,- And yet here you are.,- Did you know,that after my dad died,,I left for five years?,- Why'd you come back?,- Oh, my mom got sick.,Ovarian cancer, not good.,The paper was looking for,a journalist and I needed,,well, something while I was,here.,She died about a year later,and I would've left again,for good if it wasn't for Nancy.,She and Charlie were,still living in the house,their parents left him at the,time,,and Nancy was working editorials,for Bill.,And here I come,blowing in like the wind.,My head's still spinning from,everything,that happened with my mom.,God, I was such a mess.,She probably saved my life.,- It's because you actually,started putting down roots.,- It was a fantasy.,And what did that get me?,Dead fiance, that's what.,Nancy lived her whole,life in this damn town,out of some obligation to these,people.,My dad wasted his life trying to,do,something that didn't need,doing.,And what did that get either of,them?,- Well, that's a shitty way to,look at it.,Nancy was here because she,cared about these people,,and your dad worked in,order to give you something,that he never had, something you,needed.,- I needed a father.,I'm here right now because I,have to be,,but once I get my shot, I'm out.,- Oh, bullshit.,That is bullshit and you know,it.,You're here because you want to,be here.,No, because you love it here.,No, because,this place means something to,you.,It's your home.,Why, why do you think,you always come back?,No, what were doing, it,doesn't work in a vacuum,and try as you might,,you can't escape that.,You're just too chickenshit to,admit it.,You think that by living on the,outside,and dating married women, it's,easier,to have one foot out the door,,but that's just emotional,suicide.,And at some point you're gonna,wake up,and realize there's no,one left who gives a fuck.,- Now then, what is this sudden,interest,in my goals and ambitions?,- I'm leaving.,- What?,- I got a job in Boston.,- Where did this come from?,- I, I applied for it a couple,weeks back.,They made me an offer two days,ago.,- Huh.

I'm tapped out.,- How close do you think this,thing is,to the end of its cycle?,- Close. Look at the pattern.,As far back as I've,look, it attacks three,,maybe five times at the,most before moving on.,- It's like it stocks,up before hibernating.,- Mm-hmm, and whatever it is,,it's smart.,It knows how to stay hidden.,So this may be all we get,,and then it'll be gone and,may not resurface again,for at least a year.,- That's a tight window.,- Yeah.,I feel like I'm slamming my head,against,a brick wall because of it.,I don't know.

Life, uh, finds a,way.,- Right.,Now this reptile would,most likely be nocturnal,,you know, because it,would increase its chances,of staying out of sight,and its hunting success.,I mean, especially since it'd,be fighting off extinction.,- What about size?,How much smaller does he,think it would've gotten?,Like the size of a dog or what?,- Get this.,- I don't know.,A small bear, maybe.,- You've gotta be shitting me?,- Nope.,I couldn't believe it when he,said that,,but, of course, then he went on,to say,how this is all theory and,the chances of a creature,like that avoiding detection by,society,are astronomical, blah, blah,,blah.,- Well, at least,we should have enough,for a story at this point.,- Yeah, well, maybe, but I want,proof.,- Why?,Uh!,- Because I don't want,just a base hit, I want a grand,slam and proof will do that.,Otherwise, it's just another,crazy story. A Cryptid.,- A what?,- Cryptid.,It's a term using Cryptozoology.,It refers to a creature,that is believed to exist,,but scientifically unproven.,- Like Bigfoot and Loch Ness?,- Exactly.,- Mm.,Well, at least we have,credibility on our side.,- Clearly.,- So why not use Charlie?,If we can convince him of this,,maybe he can provide us the,proof we need.,- You know what?,You might be right.,He tags it and bags it,,we get everything we need.,- Yes. Yes.,Let the people with the guns,find the murder creature.,I'm definitely a fan of that.,You should call Bill,Seriously, this is good news.,And he's like 20 stages beyond,anxious,to get something from you.,- Yeah, no, I will, I will.,I just, you know, first,we gotta convince Charlie.,- How hard do you think that'll,be?,- Uh, well, Charlie's a rock,,tough as hell with no,imagination,,but he's also very smart.,He's trained to look at facts,and to draw conclusions, so,that reason alone, I,think he'll believe us.,- I don't believe you.,- Oh, come on Charlie.,Look at what we have here. All,right?,I mean, you saw the holes.,You heard the stories.,Wait, you wanna see the map,again?,- No.,- Harry, show 'em the map,again.,- No, I do not need,to see your damn map again.,I have heard everything you,said.,- Okay, then why won't you,just accept the possibility,that this could be true?,- Because it's foolish.,You have one half-baked,theory based on another.,It's like a house of,cards flipped upside down.,Everything you believe in,,everything you think is right,,is based on a leap of,faith the size of Montana.,- Yeah, but what if you take,that leap,,just for a second, what,if you open that brick,you call a head and just explore,the idea?,- 'Cause I don't have,time to explore the idea.,The mayor is so far up my ass,,I am spitting out buttons.,And believe it or not, genius,,it's really pretty simple.,As the population grows around,here,,we keep pushing the forest,back further and further,,limiting the space and the food,that is available to these,bears.,Yes, bears.,Eventually, bam! They collide.,- The crazy thing is I,believe you're right.,Just not the part you think.,All of these things you're,talking about,,deforestation, increase in,population.,I mean, hell, throw climate,change,and global warming on top of,that.,We've been cornering it,,forcing it out into the open to,get bolder,out of fear of extinction.,- All right. How do you explain,this rain business, hmm?,Why doesn't it happen in the,spring?,That's the rainiest time.,- Uh, not here.,October and November have,the most rainfall each year,,most in inches and most days.,All right, fine.,Then how do you explain the,disappearance,every time we send a hunting,party out?,- Coincidence.,- Coinc...? Jesus.,Max, open your goddamn eyes!,Are you so hard up for a story,now,that you will believe,anything that comes through,,even if it's not true?,And you, Harriet.,I wouldn't have thought,you would get mixed up,in something like this.,- Okay, look, I get it.,It's hard to accept at,first, but it makes sense.,No, just,,just take that hole outside, for,instance.,Have you ever seen a bear,make something like that?,Or, or leave those kinds,of tracks outside it?,What about the M.E.,report? What about that?,- What about it?,- Oh, cl,,clearly it backs up what we're,describing.,- How do you know that?,I never even saw an M.E. report.,Oh, okay.,- How is that possible?,- There was a problem at the,lab.,Some samples got contaminated.,We're still waiting.,Are you saying you've seen,something?,Where did you get this?,- Where do you think?,Charlie, that first day,I saw you in the street,,when the driver hit this thing,,you said something,about this bothered you.,Do you remember that?,- Of course.,- What was it? What bothered,you?,- The victim was,partially eaten.,- What?,- Most of his internal organs,were gone,as well as parts of his arms and,legs.,- And what about Mrs. Stirgard?,- Same thing.,- I don't get it.,- Generally, bears kill out of,defense.,They, it's like someone,threatens,their territory or they're,young.,- Meaning not for food.,- That is not always the case.,- Oh my God, come on!,I've read enough about,this in the last few days,to know that it's only,in extremely rare cases,that bears attack out of,hunger, and now we've had what?,Two in less than a week.,That's damn near impossible.,- Three.,- What?,- What do you mean three?,- Who was the third?,- A horse was killed a few days,ago.,- Oh my God.

Eating Out (2004) - full transcript,"When Caleb's gay roommate Kyle reveals that quite a lot of straight woman bed with gay men (ostensibly to convert them), nice guy Caleb considers going gay to improve his unsatisfactory heterosexual sex life. He shortly thereafter falls for Gwen, whom he meets at a party, but she's got her own sexual frustrations going. She's only attracted to gay men while instantly dismissive of any straight guy approaching her, such as Caleb. Kyle quickly moves on the Caleb-is-gay campaign to benefit them, but his motives aren't entirely altruistic. He longs for Marc, a desirable hottie who's Gwen's gay roommate. Unfortunately for Kyle, Marc only has eyes for Caleb. Kyle's plan: Get Caleb to date Marc so it'll bring Caleb closer to Gwen while putting himself (Kyle) in proximity with Marc (their true targets). But as Gwen starts putting the moves on her roommate's new boyfriend, and as Kyle becomes increasingly jealous of Caleb's time spent with Marc, and as Marc persists in laying the foundations for a long-term relationship with Caleb, it becomes a question of how long the deception can continue before something gives?","Coming!,Who is it?,Phone service ma'am.,Phone service ma'am.,Hi.,Howdy ma'am.,The phone. it's in my,boudoir.,it works fine ma'am.,Does it?,You didn't call me for the,phone.,

Al piacere di rivederla (1976) - full transcript,"I have only been able to view AL PIACERE DI RIVEDERLA in untranslated Italian, so the densely-plotted movie remains obscure to me -hopefully someone will review it who speaks the language.When it was made the working title translated roughly as PORTRAIT OF A PROVINCE IN RED, taken from the Paolo Levi novel of that name. Ugo Tognazzi is a police commissioner investigating odd goings on in the sticks, but I couldn't make heads or tails of the action.Biggest mystery here is the failed feature film career of director Marco Leto. When I saw his debut movie BLACK HOLIDAY theatrically in NYC in 1974, Leto was generally tabbed as the Next Big Thing in Italian cinema, but after this second film he was largely banished back to TV. I see several late '80s movies listed for him in IMDb with big-name casts, but they were RAI-backed productions and none of them were exported.Leto has an offbeat (and off-kilter) approach to story telling, and in PROVINCE IN RED it results in many cryptic and oddball scenes, particularly a segment where a young burglar rapes a woman, tangential to the plot.This was a co-production and both leading ladies are French for that reason (playing Italian roles): Francoise Fabian cast against type as sexy (even appearing topless) and Miou-Miou as her usual '70s free spirit -latter-day fans should catch up on her terrific work during that decade for such greats as Bertrand Blier, Marco Bellocchio, Alain Tanner and Joe Losey.","Yes, handsome...
